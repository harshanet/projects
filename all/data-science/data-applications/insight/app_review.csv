Review,Rating
Thanks a lot I feel very good when i have downloaded this app it increases the look of my cell phone,1
Its worst,1
Used too much space,1
Doesn't work a bit on my moto g,1
Hate it This does not work,1
Can't log in Fully foul. Can't access my any of website. Peoples are giving fake reviews. Ignore this foul app,1
No pin or pattern use,1
Please add the ability to delete this app from my phone as i have no need for or interest in this app. thank you.,1
It might be a good app BUT: It doesn't work on htc desire 500 dual sim,1
I use to love it!!! This WAS the only app I would use for creating ringtones and now it wont work... it sucks now!!!,1
Many permission You have download one app for one app to work? This is f**king stupid,1
Couldn't upgrade,1
Es muy mala •`_'•,1
Slows down tablet Do we need more bloatware??,1
It may work 4 out of 10 times to show the caller id with 2 seconds but mostly takes 10 second. I tried switch off the caller's image but no help. Have to uninstall it and wait until this problem is corrected.,1
Bad service,1
So wanted to try it  but ... Wanted to try it  looked like it had potential. But it won't fire up. Conks out every single time. And I have a great new phone so it's not that. Fix this  then I'll give it a try.,1
No updates or downloads possible Since a few days my phone isn't able to update or download any apps. Tried every cure available online but nothing works! Very annoying please fix this because I don't want to end up buying an apple iPhone and be imprisoned with the brand my entire life.,1
Arr wat u tll ull. I had a old version of Google Play Servise and my phone would keep on nugging me to update it and bcauz of his app my play store app stopped working. I seriously have a lot of problems only becauz of his updating issue. Why couldnt Google b happy wit d old version of it. It sucks and now even my phone is hanging But no use to telling this to the Google Play Servies people because you people never reply nor do youll try to improve you so called 'servies'.,1
"Broken with last update! I used to love this app  but the latest update has removed the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""save"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button from the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""edit image"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" screen  meaning I can no longer add captions or image metadata. A horrible oversight by the WordPress team!""""",1
Invalid QT version Not compatible with poot,1
Worst It didn't get installed. Showing error 8,1
Doesn't work on my LGG4 I can't even set my bios and cd image paths  as soon as you click on the 3 little dots to back out of the current menu to find sd card reicast crashes,1
Could be better. This emulator is constantly improving the most biggest problem is how the most played games such as pokemon take a couple minutes to load and slow in gameplay we would love if the frame rate went at least 45-50 at least then better star rates,1
Late Installation late,1
I hate it,1
Google shit Sucks balls,1
Keeps asking for an update. Promps to sign in pop up regularly.,1

Not working It is not working on 2g mobiles,1
Only loading Not working,1
Its not the real one .,1
Stars well visible on sky are merely a small dots in app - without even name or even basic data. Messier objects are significantly more prominent than stars that are much more visible. In short total mismatch between sky and what is listed in app.,1
Venky Good,1
Worst app don't download this,1
Will not connect to my site! I'm changing my password. Don't trust an app that harvests credentials and refuses access!,1
Hate,1
Unnecessary permissions Why does the new version require device ID and Call information? Unnecessary overstep of privacy allows Kodi to see my phone number and number of anyone I'm calling...,1
Irritating,1
What the fuck is wrong with this app I am trying to search in a specific folder but it is doing full search  what bullshit is this  just wasted my time  and even when the loading bar gets full it keeps going on  total crap,1
Doesn't work! Brand-new VS986 (LG G4) with root access running 5.1. Autostarts has been given root permissions but fails to see root and then does not work at all. I've reached out to the dev  but as it stands this is 100% useless.,1
Waste,1
It always sais no results get frostwire plus for more...,1
Grrrr,1
Useless Just a simple chronometer.,1
Out of control Maybe the idiot who created this app did not understand that PSP games can't be controled on android device,1
I am not able to update this app,1
Android is garbage for having 185 apps on my phone I don't need every app in the Google store wants way too much access. 185 mandatory preloaded garbage malicious spy apps on my phone I Phones are easily hacked now but atleast you can choose what has access and don't ever try to push billionaires b.s. products.,1
Instant upload not working... I just got this working by moving from oxygen os to the latest stable build of cyanogenmod 13. Now  with the latest release of owncloud  it's completely broken. Doesn't even try...,1
It doesn't update. I have tried several times but to vain,1
HTC ONE m7 Did not level properly. My eyes could do a better job hanging paintings on the wall. Zero stars,1
It's what I wanted but it's in C° and not F°,1
Suhat Ma,1
IT SUCKS!!!! I was trying to play pokemon diamond and when the professor ends the talking it goes to 10 fps and below!!!!!,1

Rohit bhai,1
This app want permission to access everything including bio security features such as fingerprint options. Shady business!!!! Be careful,1
I dont really like it Taking up to much memory slows my phone down Apps wont run unless i have the download thats kinda dumb cuz i had those apps before i got the update,1
Too large size,1
After downloading and donating to google to purchase it. It still doesn't work. It not allow me to load a local file to web browser. Who can explain me about it.,1
These services..... I hate it because it occupies my whole phone internal storage this app is poooooor or below average..,1
Identity theft at it's finest Another app forced down our throats,1
Can't find the songs I am looking for. Lots if ads. If you are looking for rnb music's not the app to use.,1
Good,1
Love It,1
Can't load black midis Ya know man  I'm all about those black midis and  this  piece of crap won't load my black midis,1
Doesn't work,1
Nice,1
Confusing. Incomplete listing. Couldn't listen to the song first....,1
Not all charts are available Worthless since the charts I need are not available. Need the Gulf Coast Heli at least.,1
The app have deleted my old SMS without my permission!!!! How to retrieve them back 😱,1
virus,1
Problems Running chameleon custom rom on Samsung infuse 4g  got bonded/embedded to rom was working fine then somehow got disabled under options automatically and can't turn back to apps only or any other option. Set to one then automatically goes back to disabled  can't uninstall and reinstall can just disable under app management  tried to disable and reinstall but when opened says can't install binary and safer disabling bonded/embedded version  can't re-enable..... love the app but doesn't work any more.,1
Nothing more than Spyware.,1
Depression,1
This App is terrible now. When it was Google Sky Map it would show you want was on the other side of the planet automatically. Now even with a GPS it still doesn't have me in the right location. So disappointed,1
Sa ne serre à rien À quoi sa sert?,1
So slow install,1
Always crashes,1
Current version useless on S3 Don't use this often so I uninstall when not needed. Has worked great in the past but this version REFUSES to work at all. Looking at moon but nowhere to be found. Titles keep flipping sideways or upside down when I cross horizon line. Orion was in front of me but not on app. Claimed south was east & west was south. Cycling GPS didn't help. Changing settings didn't help. Guess I didn't need to take pictures tonight after all. Finally installed version 1.6.4 and it works perfect.,1
Massive battery drain,1
Sucks. Dont download All it did perfectly was disconnecting me from WiFi service,1
Why report error every 5 sec Horrible. Please fix!,1
Decimal point doesn't work. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Oh well,1
No Dont install this monstet,1
nothing done,1
10 Time update karna padta,1
Bhibe YTS PAUL MHAFEYM,1
No account sync? There must be some way to sync the accounts which are added in this app so after factory reset we don't have to re-set up all accounts again.,1
"Unfortunately ppsspp has stopped I have samsung galaxy j2 and i cant play any championship matches or high level matches in wwe 2k14 It always says """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""unfortunately ppsspp has stopped"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ...Can you answer exactly ehats the problem is???""""",1
"Doesn't work at all Tried changing WiFi address  end number of times. But every time it simply says that """"""""""""""""No such device"""""""""""""""". Please fix it if possible. I'm using Moto G2. Hope to get a reply.""""",1
Consuming so much memory,1
Freak out app Not worth choosing ... Requires freaking ZXing barcode scanner which ain't got a single star 😈,1
It works quite well  but my display turns on for processes that are happening in the background too. Until this is fixed it's 3 stars from me. EDIT: I've just uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now it's only giving me the option to let the Google App illuminate the display for notifications? Where did all my other apps go?,1
It takes hours to update,1
Very disappointing app,1
It is wrost When i close talk back it automaticly opens this appis my hattest,1
When I open the App  and give the IP  it says you must use version 1.2.1 while the latest version available on the website is only 1.2. Does not work !,1
Tell Google what I think  well I'm not a great fan of Android due to incompatibility with this system .updates from any apps can cause problems  meaning an app might work on one device but not on another. You buy an app (but not anymore for me) then it gets an update and it does not work. I had a problem with the wifi icon greyed (wifi still worked even though grey means not connected) out rather than have a blue icon past several months. Googled the problem but not much luck with the solution. I deleted all the updates still no luck then deleted a piece of software called GOOGLE SETTINGS connected to GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES which was a previous update. By doing this it brought back the familier blue wifi icon to let you know you are connected. Unfortunately the latest update of Gmail crashes too on android so have rolled back to the factory version. I've been a great fan of Google for decades since they came on the scene  but Android versions does not cut it for me PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES. Sorry to say if I can give no stars I would  so my score for this software 0/5.,1
rubbish app,1
Doesn't work on lollipop with nexus 7,1
"Annoying Keeps """"""""""""""""accidentally"""""""""""""""" activating. Tired of having to turn it off everyday.""""",1
Would have been ok if not for all the ad's interrupting me trying to change the settings. Every time I went into settings it would bombard me with ad's you press the x and it takes u to some website u didn't ask for. Sort it out.,1
For years  this was the best Android mail app available. It's unbelievable how the current developers have ruined such a fantastic email utility. Many of the old behaviors have been modified to work in unintuitive ways  demonstrating a lack of basic user ergonomics. The Unified Inbox in particular is a catastrophe. Now  unread messages show before read messages regardless of date or time. Read messages do not show at all (they completely disappear from Unified Inbox) UNLESS YOU READ THEM WITH ANOTHER CLIENT (such as your desktop PC). If you read a message with another client  it will appear below the list of unread messages  completely out of time/date order. The Unified Inbox worked perfectly in older versions  but whoever has been modifying the code for this section of K-9 is essentially incompetent. There should be settings to configure the Unified Inbox behavior back to the old method if a user prefers that. It is after all the reason most of us switched to K9 in the first place. But the current behavior of showing messages read on another client in one way  and messages read in K-9 in another way  is just extremely poor development  and it needs to be fixed.,1

Hi i have a problem whit this app..,1
Aghhh. Been using this app for five years  and it has been a surprisingly useful app allowing quick and easy adding of items and ticking off when purchased. The latest update has turned it into a cumbersome tool that makes a simple task into a chore. Such a shame.,1
Completely unusable  Gives bogus track possibly by using Wifi to locate the phone.,1
Expletive deleted. It's closed-source  AKA expletive deleted.,1

looks nice  doesn't work On nougat  it seems to be impossible to play from an arbitrary position. dragging the slider does nothing  it always starts at the beginning. hence useless for me. book is a simple mp3 on the sd card  maybe one of the two is the problem. File corruption is excluded by the fact that it plays fine in other apps. I recommend Smart audiobook player.,1
Icky Made me feel odd and almost sick. I didn't like the feeling from it at all.,1
In previous versions  the configuration Exit Nodes were saved when quitting the app. Why not anymore? Thanks!,1
Doesn't work that well yet,1

Updates Have Degraded This app was great initially  now no matter what position I attempt to use it in  landscape or portrait  the board zooms out  which makes it very frustrating. Additionally  I have made no changes to my settings and I am having to manually go in and download puzzles that were previously automatically downloaded. I am thinking seriously about deleting this  as it is more frustrating then fun anymore...,1

I used this app for years on my LG Volt and Moto DROID RAZR HD. It worked flawlessly on both. It does not work properly with my new LG G3 though. It always says the compass is inaccurate and doesn't show the correct portion of the sky for where you're pointing it. Other compass apps work fine with the G3. So do other sky viewing apps. Please fix this bug so it works correctly with the G3.,1

I had this awhile back  and it worked  but I ended up getting rid of it. I reinstalled it after getting the lollipop update and now I'm having issues. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4  and like a lot of other people  the app crashes on trying to load a game and returns to the home screen. I did a fresh setup  and it says you're supposed to boot the bios first before loading a game  but even that makes it crash. All the files are correct and stored in the correct folders on the phone's internal memory  not an external SD card  which for some reason isn't accepted. I followed directions to the tee  and the app is just broken. Someone please fix this so I can finally play my games again.,1
It did not started on Samsung Galaxy Tab.,1
Used to work Now Facebook restricted it,1
The minimum supported API level This app is not compatible with Android 5.0 and older (but these devices are still new actually). Many devices cannot use this app 'cause it seems that the minimum supported API level of this app is too high.,1

To the developer  support many of your viewers need your help. Though this app is great for the inpaired it isnt of use. For those that arent. If you turn on by accident you cant turn off even following instructions going to accessibility it comes back on. How do you uninstall or deactivate. Many on line are asking google for help. The app is annoying talking ever swipe! Help,1

Suddenly unable to sync Makes this pointless. Loved this app. Fix it and easily a 5-star app. LG G3 on 5.0,1
Well this program was used in the hacking of my gaming account on Warthunder  I managed to gain access back into the account via their support system with proving that I am the real owner of the account. Their support staff kept insisting that using this crap is the best way to protect my account and now that I have access back into my account I should re activate this 2 step process using this APP. So I took their advice and although I had gone through and changed my password about 5 times that day the hackers could still access my account because of this APP  I tried to deactivate all other devices to no avail they could still gain access even after password changes  deactivation of this app being used for access to my account and then reactivation. Serious security issues with this APP and how people can not protect their accounts once recovery processes have been started and completed.,1

Frustrating I used to use OKD about two years ago and it was okay then. Now though  using the very same forms I used before  I am presented with errors. Now I don't know whether it is Google Appspot or something else  but I cannot use it any longer due to form submission errors. Also  the Google Drive option allows me to download an XML form from drive and use it but  I cannot submit it. It seems it is not even supported.

Cock blocks my wifi (turns it off every 3 minutes) Maybe I'm using it wrong... Maybe this app does what it wants with your WiFi without telling you in real time... Annoying app anyhow... Regardless of potential scenarios of the future... Needs an off button...; made do with uninstall button for now...,1

Great app for the blind. Horrible nightmare for the hearing impaired. Every time I reboot my phone I have to fight this thing while disturbing all my neighbors to get to the menu to turn this off. Should absolutely come with a permanently disable option that requires a code to reactivate. This ONE app and its piss-poor implementation has me searching for Non-Google option when I can afford to upgrade.,1
Could not connect to traccar server. Documentation lack of info on how to configure server  on what port to open  TCP or udp. Lost 2 hours searching some wiki with no success.,1

Selective Back Up The automatic back up feature on this tool isn't working at all and it's selectively choosing messages to back up. In 1 conversation of 100 messages it backs up the incoming texts but maybe 1 or 2 of my own texts. Can't even read a full conversation with 1 friend. Needs serious work!,1
Why can't I download anything?!,1
I used this on my phone all the time to work on my blog. Then  suddenly  it doesn't work properly. I've uninstalled. A shame because it was really good yesterday,1
Sucks even to have this to do anything. Corner-Marketing. It is what it is.,1

Update sucks Loved this app before most recent update. It is now ruined and I'm looking for an alternative. Put it back to how it was  please. At least until you fix the Dismiss slider that disappears if you don't press it correctly the first time. This new UI is garbage. Literally have to restart my phone to get the alarm to shut off because not even closing the app on task manager does it. Oh  and your lame responses to other negative reviews just make you look like a pompous ass. Knock it off.,1

The screen turns on only once as soon as the notification arrives.,1
Doesn't stop streaming - ever I have to use the app manager to stop streaming. I guess NPR spent their money on reporters -not software developers,1
So clunky and user unfriendly that you can't tell what's a bushfire and what isn't. Who cares about house fires you are not in?! This app is probably going to kill people!,1
Its not compitible,1
Bad - starts at boot I'm a dedicated listener and donor to NPR  but because this app insists on starting at boot time and continue running  I've uninstalled it. There's no excuse for not having an option to turn off this bad behavior.,1

You can easily find me  everyone can  I am not a coward that hides  but what I do like you in this way only 302 down in history. Give yourself up an the clock will stop. I know being a woman is hard but its the sacrifice you give me for your failure to comply. masterofhellhoundmanner,1

Good placeholder contact photo app  and now there's an expensive pro version :( This was a decent app that allowed me to create placeholder contact photos. Now you lock features with an expensive upgrade and include intrusive advertising in the free version. Unless this app gets fixed  I would not pay for more customization. It hasn't been updated in 3 months  the pictures are blurry and the contact system barely works with multiple accounts. Get Contact Photos instead. It's simple  sure  but the developers update it faster than this junk.,1

Company doesn't play well with others This company is causing others to pull their products from Google play if they integrate with it.

But now  aside from the inability to post pics and the no more messages thing (which I suspect is FB's evil ploy  not yours) the app is lagging to the point it is impossible to use when trying to leave a comment in a discussion.

Ruined the app in the new update with 2 big problems. First is the feature of changing the entire interface language is very dumb. Now I am unable to view other language wikis and still understand my app. Fix it or make an option not to have it. Secondly  Wikipedia has ruined the link popups - the read article button no longer shows unless you scroll down to the bottom of the preview. This is retarded as I can no longer click the button no matter how much of the preview I've scrolled through. Waste of time. Even worse is that I've been unable to downgrade - any older version instantly crashes upon searching. Also still had my older issues of a Visual Editor not being available for mobile and also not being able to edit more than one section at a time. Please respond.,1

You keep closing my YouTube saying to sign in and update i have PLEASE FIX IT,1
I'm furious. I didn't have a problem before  it backed up fine (I would do it manually) and it would show the conversations in my gmail. However  I checked today  and for I don't even know how long  months  it has been backing up only MY sent texts  not my received texts. So  wtf. There's no point even in having this is it doesn't even back up the received messages. That's the only reason I needed it. I need those received texts and now I have none. If I could give zero stars I would. I'm furious. There has to be a way to retrieve those messages. It went somewhere!! I always did it manual and it said it backed up and listen #/# files backing up) so where the hell did they go? I need them.,1

you tube doesn't run after update,1
PLAY. BACK. SPEED. Zero stars until that feature is returned.,1
Very nice app. But can u make it more user-friendly for Moto users by enabling full screen reading mode. Today the mute button at the bottom (even when screen is rotated) & name of the channel with too much width consumes a lot of space. Further for Moto G4 plus  the upper strip of battery n clock + bottom strip of virtual buttons remains as it is. Hence plz make updates to enable full screen mode. I have a lot of useful data to read on it.,1
I HATE IT SO BAD,1

I don't get it. You claim privacy but ask for a phone number? Interesting how GetGems can function on your platform fully supported only by usernames  no phone numbers. You can't even login to Telegram with your username  you need the exact same phone number every time. Ridiculous to think you'll only have that Telegram account with that username as long as you have the phone number. Apparently you have to supply phone logs and bills to prove you had that phone number of you lose it  so you can recuperate your Telegram account. Ridiculous. I'm going back to GetGems.,1

What does it take to clear the damn history? Removing this junk. Frequently opens on some previous page I viewed (not necessarily the last page.. It's like Tint picks a page it likes and keeps returning to it). This happens even though I use incognito by default. I have even manually cleared history and cookies  then hit the 'back' button  and it brings me to a previously viewed page. It's also just a crappy browser.,1
Pointless,1

I updated my Grab car app but won't let me use it because google play services was not updated. Tried updating it but insufficient storage will not allow it. Tried removing some stuff still wont work. So was stuck with no transpo at 10 pm on Xmas eve and had to walk home with an 8 kilo baggage. Thank you for that. I do not understand why so many apps are rendered absolutely useless when this one has not been updated. I had to uninstall everything just so i can update it. Too many permissions. Annoying.,1

Formerly awesome app left behind by lack of updates I've been using and loving this app for years on several different phones. Last update was about 2 years ago now  and as of Android marshmallow (6.0.1)  the app doesn't seem to work reliably anymore.

I'll happily bump this back to 5 stars if the devs ever update it again.,1

Think about it guys.... Wordpress has joined the herd of sheep who think that forcing rediculously complex and impossible to remember passwords  without WRITING IT DOWN somewhere  will make their systems more secure. WRONG!! The wise geeks at WordPress have completely missed how the real world works. I have now written my new 25 character letter/number/symbol password down so that I don't have to change it every time I've forgotten it when logging in. The trouble is now everyone else can see it too. DUH!! Well done geniuses.,1

"Ten steps backwards from greatness I had used k9 for many years as there wasn't another email client nearly half as good or efficient  but the latest update has introduced a number changes that make it significantly slower to use. Bring back the """"""""""""""""mark all read"""""""""""""""" in notification pull down  and let us disable warnings such as confirmation required to""""""""""""""""mark all read"""""""""""""""" in main window.

Since the latest version ALL google apps have STOPPED working along with a number of 3rd party apps. So google have FORCED an update that has BROKEN my tablet and then buried their heads in the sand and pretended nothing happened. If you have a problem google tell you to email the address on the app. Guess what if you email the address on this one you get an auto-reply that send you to google help that tells you to email the developer  way to go google!,1

If I scroll down my notification bar and lock it  the bar remains on the lock screen. It also constantly keeps taking screenshots of the lock screen. Uninstallin,1

Android KitKat breaks Subsonic I have 6 GB stored in the SDcard\Subsonic\music\ folder. I spent months trying to figure out why Subsonic was not seeing my music  and only today discovered why. It is a shame that a KitKat update (SDcard unwritable) broke SubSonic. Sindre Mehus  I hate to do this to the best person in the world  but your app is no good for me now... ONE Star for what was once a SIX star app because you do not have the option to write to your own folder on the SDcard. Declare permissions to SDcard\Subsonic\ as owned by Subsonic and let us write to it with our cache.,1

Does not install on Lollipop I am sure my phone is correctly rooted (for many other apps it works)  I have granted root permissions  but the app cannot be installed as a system app. Then I am sent to a website to download a recovery zip  but there are actually two links  one of them to an older version with an empty system folder and the other one seems to be ok by its contents (but it has only 300KB  weird considering that the app itself is more than 3MB at the Play Store). However even that one leads me to an error on updater binary.,1

Good app but torturous when randomly deletes :( This app deleted one of my blogs I've been working on for a while  which I kept updating regulary. When I finished my blog and updated while uploading photos  I come back onto it only to find theres now nothing there. I try revert and it takes me back a whole 10hours of editing! Very annoyed  what a waste of time.,1
Gud,1
Update is a disaster Well  the new update has cured my Shortyz crossword addiction. I LOVED this app but they have sacrificed everything to some designer's aesthetic. The download system (if you want older puzzles) is a sporadic mess; you can't even see the day of the week on the calendar. The keyboard choices aren't as good. And the puzzle list used to be nice and compact...now you see far fewer choices on screen. My older review  which gave it 5 stars said: This is the best free xword app I've tried. Many new puzzles daily...and from great sources like the la times.,1
Creepy sounds 😬,1
I hate it,1
Does not work on HTC One max I made the folder and put the bios in per instruction but the emulator will not let me select this as the path. It also wouldn't keep the game directory path after using it and seeing the game there at one time it reverted back to the same path that it looks for the bios in that is not even close to the same path you are told to setup in the instructions. So pretty much unusable.,1
Time waste Total time waste,1

Mouse interface  aspect ratio and keyboard shortcut. Screen-as-trackpad mouse was brilliant  now click-where-you-touch nonsense - can't see  finger in the way! Sucks. Right-click also disaster. Please return option for trackpad screen mouse. Another regression bug: Can't get aspect ratio right. Game stretched (distorted) to full screen every time! Used to work fine. Thirdly: Been using Hacker's Keyboard as on-demand keyboard and neither need nor want keyboard shortcut in top-left corner. Option to disable+hide it please? How can I revert to previous version?,1

STILL isn't working right Update: I have emailed you as well and this app is STILL not working! You say that gps doesn't need to be on  but it won't auto-connect to saved wifis. I paid for this to get additional addresses automatically connected  but--while the app does turn off the wifi when leaving an active address  it isn't turning back on when entering a known address. I thought the great thing about this app is that it doesn't require gps to remain active. Defeats the purpose if you have to keep gps on constantly.,1

The app is irrelevant to those who don't need it. It always pops up in the middle of other apps . TalkBack should be an app where the user chooses to install it rather than be pre installed on an android device.,1
This update broke it I love this app. I had a folder of art on my desktop to do this and I was so glad this simplified the process on my phone.

Much better  but still don't like the lists being on the left. I really liked maneuvering with one hand (right).

After installing this app Proximity sensor will not working while making calls and received calls,1
I absolutely love this app. It's extremely minimal and easy to use  it remembers location for any and all books you are listening to. Except with the most recent update  any newly added books won't save the location after my phone turns off. They also won't start playing until after I start playing another book and then come back to the new one. Updated rating: Fixed. Updated updated: can no longer change playback speed  main reason I use this app.,1

Installs  but never appears I've read message boards and reboots and enabled widgets and re-installed  etc.  etc.  and this thing still won't appear on my phone. It says it's installed but it doesn't appear anywhere and I can't access it. It sounds like a great app but so far it's just been a waste of my time.,1

It is a shame that the app seems to be hit by critical bugs for some. I say a shame as the server is really rather good. Since the last update the client just freezes when opening.

Samsung MEGA This app is okay; however  I would not recommend anyone downloading it. The Graphics are okay  HD Graphics (you will have to pay for it). Within the app  he tells you to click on the HD above  and it sends you to the app store to purchase the HD one. I hate all the Advertisement; which I am sure anyone would agree. This apps has a grip of advertisement. You do not have to believe me. Just download it and see for yourself. I would give the app (3 Stars)  but with all that going on  it gets a one.,1

Battery killing garbage After this last update  Google play services destroys my battery. Will go from full charge to dead with literally zero use in less than 6 hours. Usage of battery by this app is something like 71%. 4 months later and this crap is still destroying my phone. 3 hours of standby and it's trying to cook my battery into oblivion. I can't even use maps or location services because my phone will die from full charge to zero in less than an hour. Killing this and location gives me a full day of use.,1
No I do not like reading,1

Can' t Connect to S4? A nice idea on theory but in reality my S4 isn't able to connect as a hotspot  through NFC or via a direct wifi connection with the camera (that's right - even when the camera and phone are connected via wifi this app fails to detect the camera). So until Sony can overcome the apparently enormous technical obstacle of actually connecting the app to the camera via the phone  this app is as useful as a dead battery.,1

No good Have a nexus 7 every time I go to Launce it just crashes out shame  but meh.,1
Facing crash issues since this update..,1
No data  no data  no data Not worth the time. Downloaded to see my cable charge current. Tried on my phone and my nexus 7 gen2 model. Added to taskbar as suggested but never works. keeps saying no data. This is a simple app that just measures charge and it shouldn't require extra setup after downloading. Do yourself a favor and just download BATTERY MONITOR WIDGET and it works with no additional setup and smooth installation.,1
Useless on Phone I had this app in my computer for quite some time and downloaded a ton of music (old and new)  but as an app on the phone it's absolutely garbage  if it actually loads  no songs i look up come up  but most times it doesn't even load up... useless!!!,1
BAD android not work properly when i diseble this ......😈,1
It work slow,1
Photo 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲,1
Running it on a Nexus 6P with Nougat. When its enabled  the screen looks like crap  no matter what settings I tinker with. No wonder Google decided to dump this feature.,1

Constantly crashing and stops volume control on Nexus 6p,1
DON'T DOWNLOAD IT! This app WILL give your phone viruses and crash your phone. My old phone didn't have any problems until i downloaded this app. Then it started to crash and it had viruses  it crashed my phone so bad that i had to get a new phone. So don't download this app! No mater how good it is  unless if you are willing to ruin your phone.,1
That not suport my phone,1

Very Confusing I really wanted this emulator to work. I followed the directions to the tee and had no luck. There were too many folders to go through  and the bios didn't work when I installed it.,1
Waste,1
Automatically closed Android 4.4 please fix this,1
Disappointing It works really fine whenever I newly install it but after that it doesn't refresh the content and all other stuff anymore,1

Latest updste bad Was a fantastic app but the latest updated version exits without errors whenever a page is loaded. I had to revert to a previously backed up version. *UPDATE* Because of the author's failure to fix ANY of these bugs I have decided to go back to using Firefox. At least it works on my device. Developer has ignored muliple emails asking for support. App no longer usable.,1
Waste of time,1
Let me delete this bloatware app I never use. I'm not blind!!,1
No voice call. Still sync while set it not to snyc. Yes I've contacts that only purpose is to direct those call to voicemail. I dont want to whatsapp them so please stop snyc I've set it not to😡😡😡,1
It nice and OK,1
Why Icant dont downloed any books. In this app!!!! Me and my mother hated it!!!!!!!!!,1
Bad. It does not allow me to use italicised words in my title. I hope they will do something. I want to write something about a book I have recently finished but it doesn't allow me to italicise the name of the book in the title of my blog. I want to enlighten people in WordPress that there are times when you might need an italicised title. Thank you!,1
Needs an update Any time I turn off or reset my tablet  hanger decides to reset itself like I haven't installed the app before  or resets certain app times.,1
I like my privacy  why must I share? Too many permissions. All that claims it's a great app...REALLY don't explain why. If it drains your battery  then why would you give it 5 stars? If I disabled it  would my other apps continue to work? And why are we FORCED to keep it and/or update? I like my privacy and really not interested in sharing with a data hog.,1
Its consumes both storage memory and wifi data  as well as makes our phones slow and lag... the fact that this app is required in order to play my games makes me regret getting an android instead of an ios...,1
I also can't use pre-existing keys I have a private key on my sd card but the option to browse to the key doesn't work and only shows an entry named DBFile.db. This program worked before but no longer does.,1
🚨I warn anyone to buy this app 👆. This app is not working at all in marshmallow 👆and the developer lied and asked me to create an account to answer my question too. After creating the account he lied and didn't answer and he said you didn't pay for support. I already paid for the licences! You are blackmailing us with this app. Remove this app from market and go away we don't want someone who doesn't appreciate our efforts. Your app is not working in marshmallow why you keep laying? We should all report this app from down below the page to Google and ask Google to delete this dangerous app.,1
"Weak and Possible Security Risk This app wants my email password. I only give that to my email client. Why not just invoke the email client to send email? Not many other features  like keying photos to the log. I recommend """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Ski Tracks"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" app over this. Has many more features  and it works fine for non-skiers! (p.s.  Ski Tracks uses the email client so is not a security risk.)""""",1

Cannot Believe this.. New Update But Still does not support Voice and Video Call. Disgrace. This is not acceptable. Many people are moving back to Whatsapp because it has encryption for everything and also now Supports Voice and Video Call. This is the reason I will also have to move back to Whatsapp. Please Take out and introduce Voice and Video Calls and many more people will start using Telegram again. Its a Disaster that Telegram keeps taking updates out for pathetic small features but still does not su,1

Now the app wont even work as a gps at all wont calculate route and leaves an immovable error message on my screen that i have to restart my phone to remove. Worst money spent ever.,1
Really is crap Can't access it with tablet or mobile device. Can't syn with other devices. Won't accept my login info and won't allow me to create a new account. Really is a damn shame because I use it a lot when I had a computer. This isn't made for portable devices so either fix it or get off the pot.,1

I had to have them do a factory reset and lost all my calendar  texts  pics and new contacts. I spent hours setting up my phone to be a useful functioning phone again. Very disappointed! If that was fixed I would rate it differently. use any app,1

Does NOT support SPRINT. I'm not quite sure how this app can somehow NOT support one of the top 3 carriers in North America -- SPRINT -- but it does not. The app leads you to believe that this can be corrected by submitting your carrier's details  but this is a false hope. Have tried for months now to have Sprint added  without success. If the app's author would list a major detail like this in the app's documentaion (like not supporting specific major North American carriers)  it would be a very useful  helpful thing.,1

Unsearchable Why can't I search this app?

Прекрасное приложение  спасибо разработчикам. Но лично меня очень раздражает то  что оно само меняет яркость. В солнечную погоду ничего не видно  а ночью слишком ярко. Причем ночью постепенно все же привыкаешь к выставленной яркости  но если нужно открыть настройки или еще что-то  то там будет опять ярче. И даже черный фон не спасает от кратковременного ослепления. Не исключаю  что сама виновата  и где-то это настраивается  но я пока  увы  не нашла. Использую на Samsung Galaxy Note 4.,1

I'm sorry to say.. ..that it does not work on my new phone. It used to work on my note but I got the S7 and this was one of the first apps I downloaded. I love CPR and NPR so I found my local stations (88.1/90.5/102.3) but when I press play they connect and then immediately disconnect. I'll hear two seconds of radio and then silence. So I close the app  try again  same issue. If you could look into it and potentially fix this I'd change my rating to 5 stars. I can't access the websites at work so this is my only option.,1

My phone has never been rooted but because this keeps giving false flags  I can't use banking apps or play many of my games suddenly. This doesn't even work as a concept if I WAS rooted I could just hide it from you  this can only hurt regular users.,1
after install  pages are not opened due to speed becoming very slow in spite of having a strong WiFi network,1

Coins Stuck Warning*** Never Use this Wallet*** I followed the instructions from github for recovery. I correctly inputted the mnemonic & uploaded the correct zip file but I cannot push the transaction. The reason is the bitcoins were sent to an invalid address which was accepted by the green address wallet. They are now sitting in 1GXRNE7JqLTRDUvBCj9arvPGWHmN5NsG77 but I cannot transfer these funds b/c theyre not in my wallet. I'm very frustrated at this point. Are these coins stuck in a GreenAddress permanently?,1

Beware! This app has EVIL intentions I installed this app on a brand new phone so I could easily get into recovery to do firmware upgrade. The phone had no other apps than Facebook and WhatsApp. It didn't take long until my phone got hacked by this app and a third party app named recents.apk was installed that made new icon in my launcher with the google play icon and name. This app gave me full screen ads every time I unlocked my phone  and God knows what else it did in the background. SPYWARE! Avoid at all costs.,1

Go Buy DrasticDS This is pointless and not even supported anymore because the developer knew he wasn't going to start from scratch to get it running up to full speed. DrasticDS is written from scratch from the ground up to natively work with Android devices  that's why it's full speed and you can even enhance the graphical settings. It even runs on my old 1 core cheapo Android phone that I have as a backup. Save yourself the trouble and do not download this. It is not being developed anymore anyways.,1

I like it. But... The player itself it quite good and I'm happy with it. But you cannot organize the audio books. If you add a folder containing 6 different parts of a single book  they appear as 6 different files on the home screen and it randomly plays different parts with no particular order. Also  you cannot add a root folder containing different audiobooks. The only solution I see right now is to add only one book at a time and remove them after reading. Please fix this.,1

I installed this app on a Samsung Galaxy S3. After installation I went through and set EVERYTHING to lockdown mode. Nothing should have been going or coming on WiFi or Mobile. Surprisingly  traffic from my phone increased dramatically. This firwall was unable to help whatsoever in fact  it seems to have compromised my phone. I know this because I have a WatchGuard Firewall in my network between the modem and internal network so I can see every single packet of traffic on my network. Most people probably do not have such a device as they are used in Commercial businesses usually. Very disappointed. To install this I uninstalled LostNet No root firewall. As old as it is  the LostNet Firewall seems to have done a MUCH better job even though the IP tables lists are apparently dated. I would be VERY interested to hear what the developers have to say in response to this.,1

Absolute dog crap. Uploading pictures might as well take a century if they work at all. The formatting gets completely messed up if you don't use HTML  but I can never switch to HTML because the photo uploads which never finish block me from doing so. App crashes every 5 minutes and has numerous glitches. Very  very disappointed as I love the WordPress platform and was counting on this app for a blog I was doing while traveling but it did not work at all. Extremely unimpressed. 1/5. Would be 1/10 if I could give it such a rating.,1
Too slow Too slow,1
smh 150+ MB? surely if its needed for all these apps it should just be integrated into the phone,1

Safe?? Not even in the slightest! All media files received are kept OPENLY in phone storage. Setting app to keep media files for a certain period of time does not work! No self destruct passcode when forced to enter passcode. No ability to hide/delete Telegram contacts from device.. For their own safety. No ability to rename contacts for personal preference. No ability to delete files from cloud storage. This app is everything but safe.,1
I don't get how to add my account. the older version's more intuitive. Scan a barcode? What barcode? I don't get it.,1
Doesn't work anymore It was really helpful and useful for me  until the last 2 months. Now when I enable the VPN  the websites never load. I tried everything; the normal process  trying Orweb instead of Orfox  a much older version of Orbot. Nothing works. It doesn't load a website anymore when it's connected to the Tor network. And so  it's of no use to me anymore. Uninstalling until the problem is fixed.,1

Flashing ads I understand you need ads to support your project  but is the flashing ads really needed? EDIT : Google is your partner  so I suggest you take it up with them! EDIT 2 : It feels if you are blackmailing me with your flashing ads. Surly you can block unwanted ads on the Google ad network. EDIT 3 : I do not understand your attitude  just block the annoying flashing ads. Contact Google if you do not know how to do it. EDIT 4 :My problem is not with the fact that you have ads but only with the flashing ads.,1

The entire functionality of the Kiwix app relies on the ability to load external files (in .zim format) that you download separately. As such  you would think that the app would give you the ability to select a .zim file to load  but the app completely lacks any file selection dialog. I've downloaded multiple .zim files to try  but I can't select any of them in the app  so the app is essentially functionless. EDIT: Your response that you're surprised that search failed  and the solution to is to search again  complete ignores the actual problem. I don't NEED to search at all. I know where the file is. Why does the app completely lack the functionality to SELECT A FILE?!,1

The emulator sucks for being Too complicated If this emulator was really good as you say it is  then why does it need a bios file? The Nintendo emulators dont need such file to play great games. You could've just had the bios come with the app. But no.. you guys are too lazy to do it right. I had a great feeling that you sega fans were going to do this. You guys should. Fix this. Even dolphin. Emulator did not need the BIOS and flash file,1

"Didn't work Downloaded this app hoping to prevent my kids from using YouTube  Netflix  etc while on network data. It didn't work. Seems to do nothing  in fact.

Weather Won't find location. Weather doesn't work even with GPS on.,1
Screen overlay detected error... Avoid apps that require screen overlays to be disabled. This is one of those apps. The problem is  even if you disable all overlays  this app often still complains that an overlay is detected. This is simply nothing more than bad programming. There are other astronomy apps out there that do not suffer from this limitation. In my case  I could never get it to work on 2 out of 3 of my devices  no matter what I tried. The only reason it works on the third device is because I did a factory reset  then installed it. However  because it pops up this error  I uninstalled it from all my devices and I use another app instead.,1

Now every time I open it I get a message asking me to update but when I click install it gives me a message saying unable to install and to send a log of error to the developer.

Not reliable anymore. App worked flawlessly a few years ago  but now in order for the app to work without a hitch  I shouldn't change the controls manually such as volume or else the app won't do its job.,1
Absolute garbage! All it did was tap my whole 1.5gb of data and gave me nothing in return  songs never even started to download and it still wasted all my data. Don't let this app run up your bill  it's a scam.,1

After updating it crashes why it stopped working,1
"Useless misleading data on Galaxy Note 2 The mA value displayed by this app is meaningless  it displays the reference value not the actual charging value. Imagine your car speedometer would always display the maximum speed your car can travel at  but not the actual speed right now. How useless! The app displays the charging amps as 1698mA  but thats the reference charging value  not the actual. For days I've been trying to debug a battery charging problem using this app  and was totally misled by this number that it kept displaying. This made me believe that my stock charger (2A output) was working as expected  so I was trying to figure out a problem with my phone instead. I finally got suspicious when I connected a 700mA charger to my phone and this app still reported charging current of 1698. Finally I got my hands on another app """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Galaxy charging current"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" which is perhaps showing accurate data.""""",1
The App Won't Leave Me Alone I've got the app disabled  yet the hand still appears on my notification bar. I've force stopped the app so many times  now. I just want this stupid thing off of my phone.,1

The game is still unbalenced Some games you don't have a chance others just die before the first boss. You have to relearn what each potion and scroll does each playthrough. I have never seen the 4th floor boss cause the difficulty ramp on the 4th level is so high I just run out of potions/fall through the floor and die. Don't play until they fix this. I am just tired of this game. I wish getting some achievements gave some sort of percentage boost in don't feel rewarded for the work. Like 10%more gold  +1 luck  +1 strength  +1-0 armor,1
這個App很實用  不過為何沒提供了港  澳  馬新式中文版. 因為它們的句子對中台式中文版完全不一樣. 例如: instant noodles在港澳式中文就是即食麵  中式中文就是方便麵  馬新式中文就是快熟麵  及台式中文就是泡麵. 一樣的東西但不一樣的解釋. 所以我要渴望全新的吧.,1

Can't Migrate App Accounts to a New Phone! As a Google partner we use & sell Google products & advise our clients all the time to use the native apps for the best experience. We use the Google Authenticator App to lock down accounts for ourselves & our clients and I have 30 or so accounts configured. I purchased a new phone and being a Google fan I purchased the Nexus 6P. Everything just works after I login to Google except I find out I can't migrate the accounts in the Authenticator App and have to go and set them all up again. This needs fixing!,1

Yet another battery app that always reports the current as a positive value. The problem is that it is common for a device to be discharging when connected to a low power adapter (or cheap cable) because the device is using more current than is being provided. Under those conditions CurrentWidget reports a charging current when it is in fact a discharging current. So far the only app I've found that gets it right is GSAM. Unfortunately  the GSAM widget updates very slowly.,1
Stalling,1
Waste of time,1
Crashes way too many times for my OnePlus 3,1
Why do we need to download this app just to play some offline games. And it is so annoying that this app take 2-20 seconds when im starting other games/app .Give me my time back!,1
Annoying application I can't use othe apps only just not updating you? Meanwhile it's really rare to use your apps in my cellphone. Yet  updating you is very memory consuming. Really don't like it!!,1

Crap App! Ads + Tracking For five stars  release the full version without IAPs or Ads on F-Droid or send to my email (in exchange you'll get 5 stars plus a nice review on my YouTube channel). Get Adaway instead if rooted. Otherwise get NoRoot Data Firewall (it has domain filtering and no ads  also works much more stable and has a nicer color theme). To the user: The non Play Store version can block ads via a hosts file  or you can use DNS to block ads in the Play Store version.,1
Internal View Site removed The View Site feature was really the only feature I use in this app. The View Site that opens externally is pointless  I don't need an app that launches another app  I can launch Chrome directly if that's what I need. I know Chrome renders better and everything but that is not an excuse to remove a feature. App uninstalled.,1
Flash support? Nope. Anyone who knows anything about Android and Flash will know that Adobe Flash Player does not work on Jelly Bean and above. The only way to watch Flash streams is by installing.specialist Flash browsers which process said Flash via the cloud.

Is it a joke? Install this apps and apply the required setting and it does nothing  when i try to clear the cache to give another try in the apps manager  i was amazed that the uninstall button was greyed out; impossible to remove this junk by normal means.

Numerous Issues App lacks a lot of basics when trying to write a post (font alignment options and such) which is annoying. Push notifications have stopped working  even though I have them enabled in the settings. The app does not sync with anything done on another device (whether a pc or another mobile device) so I can't draft a post on my phone then do final editing and uploading on the computer or vice versea etc. So many little issues add up to an app that is a hassle to use rather than the convenience it should be.,1

Significant battery drain  and demanding permissions: if a certain permission is turned off for this app  several play services dependent apps crash and don't work  even if they don't rely on those permissions - this should not be the case.,1
Shame I have been using this app for years and have tons of data stored. It's been impossible to back it up for months now  and when I tried to send an email  the email address doesn't even work. They obviously don't care about their customers or products.,1

Not working since the last update The app keeps crashing every two minutes after the last update. Please fix it.,1
Why There is no Games,1
Does what it says. OR NO? It won't do what it's supposed to do without installing some other lame app. I moved an app  restarted and the app was totally gone from my app draw. Not displaying it on installed apps neither. It may be lost somewhere in my files or permanently deleted. I WISH I HAD A LOWER RATE LIKE -5 !!,1

I was in love with this app. That is  until I had over 400 books saved in it and one day POOF all of them were gone. I hadn't reset the app or anything  they just disappeared.

Dumb,1
Requires rooted phone for all features Wish they would have been more explicit in their description that the most useful features require a rooted phone before i spent my money on this app.,1

Be happy you've broke many people's phones btw anyone who is struggling with this uninstall the update and don't reinstall to stop error. Google fix this you've already broke YouTube now you break something essential to a phone? And now I learn I cannot play any games really? Just move to Apple xD,1
Too easy to hack,1

PEOPLE GOT PAID TO WRITE GOOD REVIEWS FOR THIS CRAP EMULATOR...Doesnt work for silent hill and others. They say to change around stuff on menu and i did but nothing helps then they try blame it on you for not understanding. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.,1
The latest update from this week is the worst one I've ever seen  it makes the app usage basically not possible. Please return the previous version it worked. Now it does not allow self signed certificate keys  which means you cannot connect it to any hardware device which do not have external certificates  especially home routers. Who will pay hundreds or thousands dollars for a certificate to connect to home router??????,1
This app sucks.how can it not find any results for a band like the rolling Stones. Etc..gave one star because you can't give none....👎👎,1

Won't let me download any games on my new tablet please could you run and fix this problem .,1
Serious performance issues This app lead me to believe my Nexus 6 was a piece of garbage. Now that i uninstalled this app  I gained an impressive performance boost! Stay away!,1
Totally time waste,1
Comon dev pay attention. Needs pause recording and to turn off that annoying beep every time you start or stop recording. Also a built in back button would allow for more screen hiding the software navigation buttons. Very nice.,1

"Because zero stars not available I woke up 12- 22- 16 and the old version is gone. The new icon in it's place. It wouldn't let me repeat alarm like Mon. Tues. Wed. etc..

I wasn't given a choice for this """"""""""""""""Downgrade"""""""""""""""". Sad. I uninstalled and went to ALARM CLOCK XTREME FREE + timer. I'm happy again.""""",1
What kind of sick twisted psycho developed this app. I skipped the tutorial  and then suddenly my new phone becomes non responsive. Complicated interface. Never install it. I would personally like to punch the developer  who forces this app in every single handset.,1
Just because It's really annoying,1
Doesn't work Connects but it doesn't seem to be using the tor network  not even with the bridge,1
Every time I pick a game  The App just automatically shuts off.,1
I dont like the fact that it wont let me Uninstall the app. When i try the setting force stop shutdown.,1
Can't see the menu. It looks OK is just if i select anything on the map the menu is not on the top right hand corner. Galaxy s4.,1
I have a zte max and it connected the first time and after that it keeps saying av format supported  what does that mean,1
This is absolute forced on us garbage!!,1
Nope. I've been using this app since 2010  and I've LOVED it. Yesterday  I had to do a hard reset on my Note 5. Everything is gone. Better yet  it doesn't recognize that I have any - none at all - music on my device. I have over 500 songs that I own. I've referred entirely too many people to this app. I apologize to everyone for that.,1

What is wrong here.... is it this update? Sooooooo.. i used to have this emulator back then about 2 years ago on a nuqleo tablet that had a rocket chip chipset now  it was working fine despite the occasional crashing. Then i got it again on an lg optimus 2x with more or less of the same problems but i could still load up the games. But now  present day  with an asus memo pad 8 with intel inside for a cpu and gpu but now it if i try to load up a game or the bios (to get into dreamcast menu screen) it just crashes instantly sooooooo.... what the heck  is it this device or this update.... ok thanks. Yala,1
Not quite sure what the problem is  but the app pretty much does what it wants to do...it never changes my wallpapers when I have it set for which is 12 hrs...I have to wait days for it to change if it changes at all. Then when I try to change my wallpaper manually due to it taking so long  the app still won't let me do it. This used to be a great app now my experience with it just sucks....,1
Why do I have to always click on the app before I see notifications. Can't it push notifications to my phone the way Whatsapp does? Fix this please,1

Broken Latest version saved an email sent using account B and signed with a pgp signature to the sent folder of account A. The two accounts are in no way related and this should not even be possible. Major bug that needs to be fixed.,1
It's bad. I hate it! The main reason why I hate is because the map doesn't register the axes at stopping. It continues to turn no matter in which way the tablet is standing. It's rotating   continuously  right after the car is stationary. Oftenly  guiding you in a wrong direction. With no problem it would get 5 out of 5 rating after fixing this issue.,1
I got no use with it,1

It used to work fine  but now every time I scan a QR code it will display the link of the page the QR code points to and after I either go to the page and then come back to the app  or just close the link and return to the app I get a message that the camera has failed and that I may have to perform a system reboot to re-enable it. This not only prevents me from using this app again  but it also disables my phone's camera! I have to reboot my phone to get the camera to work again. FAIL! This never happened in the past. I don't recall the last time I used it  so I don't know how many updates have been published since that time to narrow where the issue first came up. Too bad... I liked this WHEN it worked. Will have to check out the competition's offerings.,1

Too freaking annoying!! So many apps won't run without it  it takes up so much storage space  it denies there being enough storage space when there is and refuses to update  not to mention the constant notifications!! If I could safely delete this app without screwing up my phone I would!! It's too much hassle for too little payoff. And why is it needed for other apps anyway? That's like a serious design flaw or something. Even apps that shouldn't need it refuse to work properly unless you keep uselessly updating the damn thing a,1

Great when it works  but unfortunately that isn't very often. Most music I like isn't available on the app  and even if I did find an album  most times it wouldn't download properly anyway. Now  that would be okay with me  but instead of just deleting the broken files from my phone  it instead keeps them and makes them impossible to delete from my storage. I've got so many broken songs and files cluttering up my phone now  and I have no way to delete them because they're 'stuck' on my phone. Very  very infuriating  and it really makes my music selection untidy. Will not be using your app again.,1

This app is not theing me up date,1
Agree with others. Inability to drill down to folder level and identify the folders taking up the space make this potentially stellar app next to useless instead.,1
Hate it Waste of space,1
The worst app I came across. I wonder how WordPress could release such an useless app. Never connects to self hosted site. I can do the things better with browser. I am disappointed,1
This app simply does not work. It locks up my Andriod tablet and prevents me from using youtube and many other apps. A disaster.,1

Worst UI ever This is a great app other than they cram the navigation arrows together so close that I (and my girlfriend) wind up playing items when trying to go to the next item in the list. I would rate this as the most frustrating app ever.,1
Not updating Not syncing with gmail,1
Google play It's very big files.to update.,1
Hogs the battery. Always in use in the background. Why do I need this again? This app only has 1 billion downloads because you can't operate your other apps without it.,1

Worked great till the latest update  now pageup/pagedown swipe scrolling are broken even with them enabled in settings and terminal scrolling and resizing in general seem a bit buggered. I am jumping ship to another ssh client at this point  you guys keep breaking things and I am tired of it.,1

What happened to this app.? I think it's safe to say that phones running Lollipop and newer are experiencing issues. My old phone and tablet runs KitKat (4.4.2) is and this app runs perfectly on it.,1

No explanations If you set it up and don't have any issues it works great  but once you purge your phone and try to reload things there's no explanations of why how to set it up or why to set it up. I'm just lost. Now I can't get into my Google account on my other computers.,1
it's stupidity !! ;c,1
A great app...if nothing had changed since 1991. To move a file you have to type the file path. Do I need to say more? I used it once and then uninstalled it.,1

Horrible bug in this. If there are multiple editors who have password blogs  unlocking one unlocks them all despite different passwords. Even if you clear the cache and force stop. This is a WRETCHED big that needs to be fixed. Deleted because of this crap.,1
Useless The add at the bottom of the screen is blocking all of the edit options. So it's just a useless app at this point. The preview video looked great! Make an app that actually works like that.,1
CANNOT SCAN BARCODES!! It keeps saying barcode scanner not available,1

Your app sucks  it interferes with other apps and always needs updating. Also you send my information to 3rd parties....,1
If this app is by mistake opened or activated then you have to run a software to deactivate it which costs around ₹250-₹300 averaged in India . Once it's ON A then you cannot switch off by your own handling like swiping the screen. The only first part which a screen shows of the menu is accessible. If you tried to swipe it down or swipe Right to access view another menu icons you cannot unless you deactivated by a software from mobile shop. If it got activated then understand your mobile will stay hang forever or fucked..... Hated it,1

No good to the rest of the world I would have liked to have tried it out but nowhere do I see that this is for the US  New Zealand and Slovenia only?? It would be nice if you let people know that before we go through the trouble of installing it first. Let me know when Southern Africa is working.,1

Not a single barcode or QR code got scanned by this app. There are other apps that get it while I'm barely pointing it  so I'm sure it's not my phone.,1
Ok google officially you are crap. Out of the people who bothered to rate this malware  30% now rate this as one star. Is that a clue to sort this stupid piece of code out. It is not an app as it bears the user no benefit. I have bought an app. It now tells me it wont run unless I update this.. you are holding me to ransome. Why should a purchase need me to use your code??. Your car is needs petrol but still works when you use texaco or bp. It does not stop on the freeway because you use a different petrol provider. SORT IT. Every time there is an update more of MY data not YOURS gets sucked down. Now you want sms messages access to protected areas take our contacts. If the police wanted this data they need a warrant  no google wants this and its rediculous permissions to be accepted. Shame on you google. Bugger me wants to control nfc..... This is supposed to be a piece of software that enables third party apps not a stealth data stealing weasel. Apps that used to work require an update to this ----- why---- because Google insists  not necause the app needs it. It is so you have to have this malware on board.... Come on let it do what it is supposed to do  be an enabler.,1

When I click the next button it goes back to my first name  I click next again it goes back to my last  click next again it goes back to my first. I hope you get it. Can this be fixed? I would really like to use this app.,1

My NEXUS (Android) tablet doesn't allow me to access the files of my tablet! So I can't play at all! Here's a tip: DO IT YOURSELF!!! Have the bios in the folder so that we don't have to go through the trouble of doing it for you.,1
Can i put 0 stars Too many ads. So annoying. If i press back it asks if i want to go to the home screen of the app  i press yes it plays an ad.,1

It used to be good... One day  it stopped working. Now it can't create or modify files. The builtin bloatware file manager that came with my phone with the terrible interface still works  so I've been forced to go back to it. Deleting app. It was good while it lasted.,1
I think that it is annoying because when i try to open a page it says Sorry we cannot find a matching file😴😴😴,1
Does not support/unable to login self-hosted sites What's the point of publishing an app with a feature that does not work  or needs many workarounds or tinkering to fix? Two of us own a NAS each  and I know of some colleagues who use LAMP stacks  and none of us have managed to log in. It looks like we're forced to have a freemium account  under the pretext of being able to use Jetpack too  just for the luxury of posting from a simple app. It's a shame  since the latest update to the main program is still a dream to work with.,1
If you try to leave the app it sends you to publicity. I have the feeling its to make you leave this app running in the back ground.,1
Garbage.,1
Poor New update Force Close whe i try instal app,1
Ugly icons,1

No longer open source? I'm a little disturbed that this was open source and is now not. I refuse to use this app anymore as I can no longer trust the integrity of this app.,1

I just started using telegram today  and the app has failed the first task it's supposed to do. Import my contacts!!! If I can't see any contacts then how am I going to chat with others conveniently through this app. Major turn off. I've tried everything from your bug reporting page. Close app  restart  changed contacts to international number  changed contact name and reverted. All still lead to the same result: nothing seen in contacts. The only way I can now see contacts is by adding them manually but damn why the heck would I manually add over 100+ contacts again??? What a let down. AND I'm very sure that the contacts that I tried adding have telegram too  and obviously I've allowed the app to access my phone contacts DUHH.,1
not WORKING it doesn't work,1

What happened? It used to run excellent. Now it boots up  goes to landscape mode then automatically closes. Plz fix this issue. It seems I'm not the only person this is happening too.,1
Just spams your root getting permissions for the same few things over and over killing your phone. Doesn't do anything useful. App itself will just auto close if you open it with no crash being recorded.,1
It requires damn space after installation..,1
Fix and I'll redownload It wouldn't ever open so I had to delete it  fix it and I'll try it again,1
Because it's your fuc*ing monopoly !,1
"Does not deliver Confused as to why people think so highly of this app. Just because the app says the cache is clear? To verify I simply looked at one application's cache  ran the cleaner  looked again and it was unaffected (yes  I refreshed the screen).

Very broken NPR seems entirely incapable of reliable podcasts on Android now. I've used this app for a couple of years  and it has gotten progressively worse as time passes. Lately it frequently skips back and forth in the audio  and usually quits altogether two thirds through the progam.

Originally used to replace widget on Samsung S series phone when built in widget disappeared. Had difficulty at first since when installing only downloads settings icon but not widget itself. Fooled around with it and suddenly the widget started working on phone. It's a great widget working so well on phone I decided to add it to my Samsung Note Tablet 10. Same issue as before. Installed settings icon but no calendar widget even though settings are set to my default calendar. I can't recall how I got widget itself to appear on phone and I'm hardly a mobile device illiterate. Something is wrong when you create an app that doesn't make obvious how to activate full widget. Uninstalled. Waste of space unless you know how to unlock the magic key to get widget itself to appear on screen. Fortunately old widget still working on tablet although it's not as good as one on phone. Going to get new phone soon and wonder what will happen if I try to install this on new device. Useless without widget! Surely I'm not the only one with this issue and nothing on Github.,1

Once again a text to email app that does not work for me. When I get back up all it did was say that it backed up one item and it wouldn't tell me what item and I saw nothing in my Gmail. I've been trying to backup my texts for 3 freaking years and cannot find an app that works. My phone is overloaded and out of space.,1
all settings are good but whatsapp messages not going to gmail. any body reply?,1

I thought this was the function I had on my S4 that reads your texts aloud. It was the most annoying thing ever couldn't control it. Why did Samsung do away with that feature it can save lives on the road for business people who need to hear texts in the car. Dumb move I have a J7 Even my friends with better Samsung phones don't have the read aloud text feature. Dumb.,1

Supergroup Admin job is very tough No clear history option is available to Supergroup admins . At least Select all option should be given while making selection for deletion/forwarding. That will help the admin to manage content in short span of time. Moreover its very difficult to delete old messeges one by one. Please show some mercy on admins. We are not able to rollback a well formed super group to normal so please consider it.,1

Required Barcode Scanner doesn't work The required barcode scanner lacks the ability to ever achieve focus on a barcode on my Samsung Galaxy S4. Unfortunately this makes this application completely unusable for me,1
Far too complicated to use. Am absolute nightmare to set-up and I am IT trained to high degree. Steer well clear. A normal IT person would usually find it fairly easy - but by lord  this app manages to make even that job a nightmare. Regardless  if this app is supposed to be aimed at & used by the average user  they are up against it in just trying get their head around its set-up - before they even use it - if the rare odd person can. NOTE: The write-up for this app doesn't say that its for specialist users - nor presently  does it direct ordinary users to another simpler version? I suspect now that might change?,1

What went wrong?!?!? My favorite game app--used daily on Samsung phone  and Samsung  Nexus and Nextbook tablets--until the last update. Hate it now. Unwieldy settings...most of which don't work most of the time. App won't register puzzles as completed; delete function doesn't work; sometimes it won't download day's puzzles. What a mess.

Only works with people who have the application,1
This app is lame,1
Asks to update again & again why ?,1
What happened?? Won't stop force closing.. Fail..,1
It gives you know choice in installing it forcing you to update it because it's a system app. It takes up only a few first looking at the image but it takes up like a 183 mb too much space is being wasted on this pointless app,1
Needs alot of work still. Not much use for people that are Truly disabled and handicapped. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 I am Very Disappointed that Google hasn't made this application a thousand times better  than this application currently works. A person with disabilities or a handicap such as myself really find this app pretty worthless. I say this because it needs way too much work still before it will work correctly for people that are disabled and handicapped. It WAS a great idea with but with TERRIBLE IMPLEMENTATION by Google. This application is way more useful to people with no handicap at all.,1

Didnt work. Couldn't find a single song  kept saying no matches.,1
Tried it for a year still won't allow auto-rotation It's 2017 and this app still won't allow auto rotation. I typically read the news on my Pixel C at breakfast with the Pixel attached to and propped up via it's hardware keyboard which only places the device in landscape. NPR News app only displays in portrait mode so for me it's not very handy. The AP Mobile  Reuters  NY Times  CNN  MSN and even the NPR One news apps all display in either orientation. Since I've get more user friendly options I'm uninstalling this app.,1

Disappointing. It's a great idea in theory (worthy of 5 stars); wonderful if it actually worked for me. Over the years I've tried Kiwix on three different phones and one tablet  and am sad to say I've never been able to run anything more than the demo. The larger databases always crap out somewhere in mid download  or fail to open  or suddenly go missing just before they finish  which is particularly annoying after waiting a couple of days for the download to complete. As I said  I would love to have this app if I could get it to work on any of my devices. And I should also say that I sincerely appreciate the work you've done; it's a terrific project. Maybe some day I'll get it to function for me...,1

Miserable app I agree with 1-star raters. This app sucks.

Major security flaw Let's say I have 2 devices  device A and device B. Currently  for the same account  the Authenticator app only allows one device to have the codes.

Since version 2.5.2 there is no search by address functionality anymore. Now to find anything in other towns you could either scroll there (but that won't help if you don't know where the town is located) or write the complete name of the town (you just need to be able to spell the names of all towns and villages correctly)  and then scroll through the endless list of streets (if you are not sure how the name of the street is spelled exactly  and whether it's a street or alley or something else). What took 2 seconds before  could take several minutes now (if you're lucky).,1

Resource Hog Uses a tremendous amount of RAM and drains the battery very quickly. Edit: (11/30/16) They apparently did something to correct the problem somewhere around September  but updated it again on November 2nd and it's back to the same old memory draining  multi task running hog. As soon as I uninstall it  the phone runs like lightning again until it self reloads at some point.,1

A lot more testing needed before updates are released. You can't just use updates as your Open BETA test. Each update to change insignificant UI ruins the basic functions.,1
I think it was wash of time,1
The ads serve malware Recommended to build this from source instead of installing from the store. Ad networks could have any number of issues depending on how they're implemented  but in any case  they make the app hard to trust.,1

Bakwas,1
Loved this app but it suddenly started draining both data and battery. First warning was a text from my operator saying that I'd used 6GB mobile data in a couple of weeks last summer. Checked the phone and it was almost all down to K9. Disabled background data — hardly ideal — but I was prepared to give the program another chance. Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems  only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month. At the risk of stating the obvious  this is insane! Having persevered with this for years  I've now given up  uninstalled and gained about 3 hours battery life per day. Should be removed from the Play Store.,1
Eats too much storage and would not update. Blocks useful stuff,1
HAted it Plz dnt use this guys,1

What happened? There is a serious problem with Android release 4.3 of Subsonic.  I upgraded to this version last night  and overnight accumulated over 10GB worth of data charges (yes- 10GB).  This is way more than I typically use in 3 months  and I am being charged &gt; $100 USD for this overage.  My player was not being used at all at this time  and I had it next to my bed charging. I verified that the data usage was associated with Subsonic. I would normally rate this a 5. Please fix this ASAP.,1
Doesn't work on s5. Used to be my favorite app. I am so disappointed.,1

Started out bad - got worse When I first launched it  read zero steps. Took 30-40 steps to test it and it read 65 556 steps! Tapped the counter screen and somehow it went to over 131 000 steps. Tried to reset it through settings  but apparently you can't do that or its not obvious. It also somehow affected my iMprint fingerprint reader. Trying to unlock my phone with it failed most of the time with this app running. Had to uninstall it.,1

My I.Q. is 142+ (testers unsure how high it really is) just like a lot of you guys and gals. I rooted my Hipstreet Pulse with KingRoot ( no P.C. as mine needs a new UEFI BIOS chip). It checked out as rooted but I restarted this tablet and the Root was gone. I am sorry to the developer but I am at my wit's end.,1

Seriously what are you gonna do witb that information? Oh I know leak my personal information in the internet and make money out of it.,1

Poor synchronisation behaviour Unfortunately the synchronisation behaviour on my device is extremely annoying; it repeatedly tries to download the same podcast episodes. Even when I select cancel  it simply retries immediately afterwards. There appears to be no way to turn the synchronisation off but I tried setting it to wifi only to at least temporarily shut it up. This results in repeated download attempts labelled 'null'. Uninstalled.,2

"This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read  write and relax  but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing. This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example  instead all we get is the """"""""""""""""discover"""""""""""""""" feature which only promotes bland  vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories  or video game strategies  or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive  to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is  otherwise you have to look it up manually. There are no set categories or tags  instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post  which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers. People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted  discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want. You can't dislike posts or comments  so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways  while WordPress does not. The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear. All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community  and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.""""",2

Great idea but app broken. I've used this app before to report an issue which was sorted in days! Which was great but this app is now broken. Map tiles don't display even on latest update (writing this on 29th Sept 15) so impossible to pinpoint problem area and no exit button nor easy way to get back to map after viewing other reported problems. Also maps need greater detail to help pinpoint problem.,2

Android gets shafted Sadly this app is so much better on iOS. Searching for stations is a pain. Why cant there just be a long list to pick from? Often it is difficult to get a live station to play.

Now I am uninstalling and using Google Keep to sync between my Android phone and the Mac OS X desktop app. Sorry  this app is not ready for prime time.,2
Trivial bugs frustrate While this app  supported by NPR  provides the best content  it is hampered by bugs. At least 1/2 the stories listened to via a playlist start at the wrong position in the audio (the ending time of the last story- how is it I could determine this definitively and yet it hasn't been fixed in years?). Definitely my most used app- but I suspect any app with NPR's official sanction would be.,2
It doesn't work I tried to back up and restore my messages several times but it would constantly freeze in the middle of backup. Furthermore  the auto backup that I had setup never worked so when my phone crashed I lost my text messages.,2

Not showing up in android 6.0.1 Sometimes the widget disappears from the widget menu  just the settings widget comes up in the widget menu. Wasnt a problem ever before the marshmallow update.,2
Stupid update The ability to mark all as read quickly was the star feature of this app. As others have said to change it and not let the user choose  when you already have an interactions menu is just dim  I'll give it a week before I move to another program and stop recommending this to my clients.,2
Constant errors freezing my tablet I can't use Gmail without it on my tablet and its constantly glitching. Recently it kept stopping and the error notice popped up constant freezing my entire tablet. I had to uninstall all updates of every aspect of it  remove all caches of each aspect then finally uninstall and re install whether i wanted to or not. The whole time the error message popping up and freezing it. Instead of minutes it took at least an hour of frustration. Happen 3 times in 6 months. I feel blackmailed into having it when all I need is the Gmail and no other aspects.,2

Used to be great....on a desktop! Unable to play or store music after latest lolipop upgrade. Original fw was awesome. Android google has decided that those who refuse cloud player must have no music. Sad. DRM preventing us from saving our own owned and ripped from disc files blows chunks.

Not what it used to be Unfortunately  this app has become frustratingly difficult to use. It randomly defaults to either portrait or landscape mode (regardless of settings) and whilst in portrait mode will not scan 1D barcodes.

Does not work on lock screen with Android 5.0+ The description says this app is compatible with Android 4.2+. What they fail to mention is that lock screen widgets are no longer available in Android 5.0+ (Lollipop). I downloaded this specifically for lock screen notifications but that feature is no longer available with 5.0+ devices. You can however still add the widget to your home screen from the app drawer  just not the lock screen. I would raise my star rating if they figured out how to get the lock screen widget to work with the current releases of Android.,2

Easy to use  few permissions. Often crashes. Does most file management tasks  (including on external SD card)  with small footprint and minimal permissions. Crashes every time Rename is attempted  and crashes randomly at other times. Often has graphic issues after long press to select. Not at all landscape friendly. I think abandoned by developers - no fixes for 2 years. Only keep now to create shortcuts to folders. Android 4.2.2,2

"Clip Stack surely does the job it proclaims to execute. However  there isn't much value in the application because a typical """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Notepad"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" application pretty much does the same job if you wish for text and other media like a file. It would have been awesome if the contextual clipboard is presented with the option to pick up the values from """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Clip Stack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". For instance  I navigate to a website and would want to paste multiple values in the text fields designated. If I attempt to copy a value from Clip Stack app and then navigate back to the website to paste those values  it would take me a lot of time. Instead of that  WHAT IF soon after I long-press on the field  it presents with the option to paste content from the clipboard as well as present me a snapshot of values from """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Clip Stack""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  which way I should have attempted to pick and paste one of the values from the application. This would be more intuitive. Not sure whether Android provides us a way to achieve it. But  such a feature would have truly been awesome instead of the existing features. Application design surely is commendable. But  unless the aforementioned feature has been added  we would not be finding it usable.""""",2

[UPDATE]None of the extension that I use (Inbox  Weather) seem to be updating the home screen info. So other than date/time  I now get little out of the widget. Too bad.[/UPDATE] After trying a number of clock widgets  this one seems like a keeper. Only used it for a couple of hours  so don't know if there are other issues  but the biggest improvement for me would be supporting double-tap  when the widget is expanded to the full home screen. Double tap turns the screen on/off on LG G3  and it's one of my favorite Android features. To make it work  I need to leave some free area on the screen  but this means  I cannot display everything I want in the wizard. Would be lot more user-friendly  if the widget just passed the double-tap signal to the OS.,2

For years on many phones and computers  I've been able to import a self-signed certificate  but that doesn't work in the app now. Looking at the logs  my laptop is communicating with the server  but the app is not. I now have to update passwords from my laptop and redownload the database on my phone every time I make a change.

App is overall good  but on my Nexus 4 i was able to record at 720p 120fps only once selecting 40mbps and 60fps.. But I can't success that score again. On my other phone MTK 6795 x10 capable of 480fps in 1080p  can't even choose that high speed mark,2
Loved this widget but since none of the weather extensions appear to work anymore  I'll probably stop using it. Upgraded to Android 7.0 and now constantly get API errors on all weather extensions.,2

Good News spoilt by bad App. Horrible banner ads at bottom take up huge part of the screen. The NY Times has given up on this stupid idea to place ads. Please remove them. Makes me want to not contribute to NPR anymore. And yours is the only app that requires the load more stories touching. All other apps are smart enough to load more upon scrolling  or just loading it all anyway. Poor App design that hasn't seen improvements in ages. Please invest in your mobile App so that NPR stays relevant. need NPR badly in today's partisan media,2
Can't restore MMS messages! What good is it to have the option to backup mms if you can't restore them? It constantly says that feature isn't available yet. Will it ever be available!?! I've been seeing that message there for a long time with no sign that it'll actually ever be made available. So why even have that? I thought I had backed up everything but when I went to restore  some very important pictures were missing from my messages because the mms restore feature doesn't work!,2

Doesn't work - please update your app to reflect this While the author says in his description that the widget doesn't work with Motorola and Samsung  yet according to the Google Play store it is compatible with my device. I installed it  and it shows  always  1 mA charging  or 0 mA discharging. Great idea  but it's not compatible with my phone (Samsung Note 3) so please update your information/programming so it doesn't show up as being compatible with my phone. 1 Star for the idea  which is good  + 1 Star as the minimum you can get = 2 stars. Thx.,2

Good concept/Moto alternative but strongly lacking Doesn't seem to work well with fingerprint sensors as it has basically rendered mine useless to unlock the phone with this app active. Also  doesn't seem to wake very well after movement over the proximity sensor  and doesn't seem to have any settings to adjust the sensitivity  like I've seen similar apps do  defeating the purpose of this app.,2

Slowconnection Slowconnection,2
Don't do it! If you install this  it tells you that you have a limited set of stats unless you're rooted... Once you root the phone and install this it gives you the option of installing as a System App to enable the use of the other features... If you say yes to this  understand there's absolutely no way that I've found to easily remove this app from the phone and it is granted complete access to the system. I've reached out to the developer to ask for help uninstalling the app and will update this review if he can provide me with an easy way to get it off.,2
Needs Work I wanted to like this app. Especially since the company is local to me. However  the app constantly crashes and claims there's a connection issue. There is no connection issue. Please fix.,2

Buffer & Bluetooth Issues I'm glad the app exists as it is my primary source of NPR. However  the app often takes a few minutes to buffer before playing. Also  most frustrating is that if my speakers change (I.e. I turn car Bluetooth on or off  etc) NPR stops streaming and I have to re-buffer. The stream is also interrupted by my phone's other alerts and phone calls - even when I don't pick up the call. If the phone rings at all  the connection to NPR is lost.,2

Looking for features? If you are looking for features this is not the right app for you. It seems like the app wasn't updated for ages. It's not possible to sync a whole folder which makes it exhausting to sync anything. You have to open a folder and click each file seperately. Also it is not possible to sync periodical or on file change. However the app connect to your owncloud server as a charm and seem to download / upload single files well. Not exciting for advances users though.,2

Something changed This alarm used to work quite well for me but recently I overslept a few times. I thought I just didn't hear it but this morning I actually watched as it passed my alarm time without going off. I snoozed a couple times and it showed on screen that it was to go off in 1minute  I waited and then 2 minutes later it showed the time for my next alarm. I liked the swipe to dismiss feature but I may look for another app  as this issue makes it ineffective.,2

I really want to give it 5 stars but.. I've had this app a week and I was really enjoying it. Untill I found out that my messages weren't going through. Then I started getting sending errors and even resend errors. Not sending the text is a deal breaker for me. YOU HAD 1 JOB  CARL!,2

Please update it Hi  i am a great fan of your product. why you won't update it? Cheers.,2
Ridiculous It's impossible to beat if you want to do like an actual explorer and EXPLORE. From hoards of rats that dodge every other attack and piranhas that can barely be hit and swarm you  to ghouls that I'm pretty sure you can't even harm with the starter weapon... in general  completely unfair and leaves you to die very very easily.,2

Used to love but can't use with Lollipop Loved this widget on the lockscreen of my LG G3 but Lollipop seems to have taken away the ability to have any clock on the lockscreen except the ridiculous circle clock that I can't see without my glasses. Too bad because I really liked it.,2
I don't care for the interface. The puzzles won't fit properly to the screen  it won't skip existing letters  it auto jumps to the next clue. Needs polish  but it's unplayable for me,2

This update sucks,2
Bloatware  spyware. Cut out the crap and give a version with basic functionality. Put your pryware and crap elsewhere. At least dump it off regularly and leave just necessary data in the caches for our apps. If not I expect a percentage of revenue off anything you plagiarised from my devices records. Otherwise expect much more competition and litigation. Be part of the solution and lock in brand loyalty while you have the freedom to try new approaches or find yourselves painted into a corner away from the leading edge,2
Update It won't even let me update it  the app is good but I can't update it! Pls fix,2
Doesn't work on Nexus 6P Nice idea  really want an app to replace Moto X active display but no luck here.,2

WP links on Twitter or Web should open on App If I click a WP link on social media or on the web from my mobile browser  why doesn't that link automatically open in the WP app in my mobile?

Did nothing I kept seeing this app mentioned when I searched for solutions to my phone's WiFi dropping every few seconds  so I decided to give it a shot.

Bad draining battery! Drains battery all the time it get boring!!!!!,2

UPDATED: Fantastic client and my default for many years. 5.203 has two big problems. Messages load slow  real slow. And the attachment is now indicated at the bottom of the message not at the top. So you can easily miss it. This is a deal breaker for a default email client. THANKS FOR FIXING THIS: The last two updates (this year) broke message reply. I use dark theme. In the reply window  the message I'm replying to is now either light theme or most appears blank. In the past it would be visible in the dark theme. The part where I'm writing is still dark theme. Please fix. Thanks.,2
The scroll bar on the right overlaps the message stars  which makes this app unusable if you need to star and unstar messages. Is anyone from the K9 project using their own app?,2
It's ok,2

Some errors ! The downloaded file can be accessed from only the downloaded tab and not from the downloads directory. Update: No Tabs ? WHAT?,2
Missing features There is a description of ISO  but that's only seen in it  not in the application. Also the Quality is the same as stock camera  even set at 100% jpg quality. Had been a great option if possible to add ' metering mode ' too.,2
Integration failed This app looks like an alpha version compared to Keepass2Android. Hard to integrate to OneDrive for sync with PC. Must install OneDrive separately and re-enter path to database Everytime we start the app. Missing features such as quick unlock. Unusable for my usage for these reasons. Fix those 2 things and I'll give 4 stars.,2

Great simple interface for passively tracking  but it misses steps  doesn't save data beyond a week  and doesn't count in realtime. I tried this after hearing it was tailored to the Nexus 5's built-in pedometer  but found that it still seems to come up short. When manually counting steps it seems to miss about 1 every 25 steps  and this corresponds to being a few hundred short by the end of an average day (~10 000 steps). Admittedly  this is better than most apps... but there are nonetheless other apps that seem to miss fewer steps. Another major issue is that it only tracks steps for a week  not saving the full record. And a minor annoyance is that it doesn't seem to count steps in realtime... rather  it seems to bulk-update after some unknown length of time. So I'll wake up and walk a mile to work and it'll read only 7 steps when I sit at my desk  but sometime by lunch it'll jump up to a couple thousand.,2
Why do every game need an update of Google play,2

Why it is not updating on my phone?,2
Well  authors fixed bugs  and this app again used to work great... but under the last version of Android it does not run in background. So to backup calls and sms you have to run the application explicitly from time to time. Please fix that.,2

Easy to report faults  pants trying to view others If you want to report a fault quickly  great. Log in  locate yourself  report. Job done. However  try to view other faults locally and it all falls apart. On opening the app you can view the map  select a fault and view it. There it ends. You can't go back to the map and select another. The map view doesn't appear in the menu. The back button doesn't work. Oh  and you can't exit - you have to minims then kill in your app manager. Shame. So much potential.,2

Difficulty based on chance and obfuscation This game has every element that should make it good. Unfortunately there are several classic blunders that just make it missed the mark. Food is required  yet food is not plentiful within the dungeon. All items you pick up are unidentified the first time you see them yet you don't get enough ways to identify them short of using them and hoping. I suppose over time you would learn what all the items are  but if that's the intention what exactly is the point. It is a useless mechanic.,2

Something wrong since updating to android 7. Now every time I double tap to see the original photo or unlock the phone and muzei starts the wallpaper goes black and then brightens up. Like its calibrating or something. Never had a problem before but this is making it almost unusable. Please fix.,2
Download path? Biggest problem with it is that you can't choose download path  it automatically downloads everything in a default path. Second  it takes ages to load. Why can't it keep the torrent list and just update it in the background each time I open it? I am sick and tired of waiting so much every damn time I open the app. Also  the RSS feeds don't even load if they have more than 50 entries. It just tries to load them and after some time you receive an error message and that's it. Literally the only functionality of this up is that it puts torrents in your seedbox. Doesn't do anything else.,2
Would rank higher if The bugs that cause it to freeze and crash are fix then it will get 5 seriously fix the bugs,2
It does not find everything like before Idk if there is a problem with this app  but years ago I used to love it and find anything now I can't  I gotta use 2 other apps just to find music if frost wire can't find it.,2

"I wanted to inform you that I will be uninstalling your app and ceasing listening to any of your programming. It has become apparent since the outcome of the most recent election that NPR and its affiliates are more interested in opinions than news. More and more of your coverage is anti-Trump and pro-bias. You can be informational without being opinionated. I just read an article that repeatedly said Trump """"crowed"""" instead of """"said"""". It happened over and over. That is unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing to the content being presented  other than the apparent and publicized view of the writer. The combination of the polarized coverage  the large increase in typos/grammatical errors/incoherent sentences  and the decrease in professionalism in word and phrasing choice is more than enough to show that unbiased reporting is no longer a priority to you. Because of this  I will be taking my leave from your programming and I will continue informing/discussing this disturbing loss of NPR's ethics with my friends and family.",2

Poor Refused to scan both the Ikea barcodes I had lying around  crystal clear black on white. Tried to use in conjunction with excellent My Groceries app  but failed to recognise any of the Lidl product bar codes in my kitchen  so no use at all I'm afraid. It also struggles to focus (that was not the problem with the aforementioned)  preferring the carpet over the barcode; maybe that's my phone's fault? Seems no way to set portrait mode  so it's awkward to use.,2
Very upset was working great for about a week.. Then just shut down only restored some not all.. Fix it and it will be 5 stars,2

Lot of flaws... Sometimes I travel to Algeria  when I select USA as a region in your app there will be no changes  which means that the Algerian play store won't change to American  moreover your VPN makes internet connection tooooooooooooooooooooo much slow...really guys what's happening with you ? This app sucks... Bcz you did many efforts to make the app I will give you 2 stars.,2
Very bad It is so redicilous,2

Source of performance & battery issues This is a great app when it's doing what it's meant to do in the background.

Can't understand the 5 stars It doesn't seem able to manage its own internal files. Several times I had to go into /data deleting swapfiles of Vim Touch's config files. It doesn't seem to have any resilience to its own preference settings. Even if your phone is rooted  don't set Vim Touch's Root option! It will never start again so you can't switch the option off. Other pref settings and normal vim uses also do this. And oh wow: *don't* try using vim encryption. Hangs and force quits everywhere. Then it made 3 of my files become zero size. All my 40+ others apps are working fine. I can't understand the 5 stars for Vim Touch. Perhaps people are just enjoying it as a toy or a novelty. But if you try to do anything half-serious with it it will break and take some of your files with it. (HTC one rooted with very stable CM10 and no problems in other apps),2

Will eat all your data in minutes Start your up / download while on WiFi... all good. Your WiFi drops momentarily for myriad unknown reasons and the download continues over LTE.

Crashes on Messages I would give this 5 stars but it crashes every time I try to access my messages in the app. I have removed and reinstalled the app  signed in and out  even reformatted my phone. But it still crashes when I click Messages  every time without fail.,2
Okay  but the 1000 messages limit is dealbreaker for me I'm looking for convenient and secure popular-messaging-apps replacement that are not sharing my details unless asked to. Sadly  their fixed 1000 messages limit means I simply can't use it for long-term. Too bad  because all the other features look ok.,2

Huge potential  simple yet powerful and fast  without ads or asking for unnecessary permissions  but here are few things that could help making this my default gallery app: 1- the option to make the background black only when in preview mode (when the status bar etc. hide away). 2- double tapping to zoom making the photo pixels match the pixels of the phone display in 1:1 ratio. 3- perhaps a 'material design colours' pallette for choosing colours in the theme/customisation section?,2
Das PrOtiK,2
# Not v. Good app It is not very good app beacause it is used large size in phone memory I don't like it 😕😕😕😕😕😕😡,2
The concept of simple apps with minimal permissions appeals. Lots of new features being added  but the basics are not being sorted  bugs in each release  and ongoing problems not being addressed. ▶Major issues ① Won't open pictures shared from some other apps  eg can't open email (K9) picture attachments. ② Sort by 'date taken' not working  all my pictures are jumbled up. I suspect they may be in 'date modified' order. ③ Last few versions: Most pictures (particularly in main camera folder)  very slow to open or don't open at all  just getting a grey screen. ④ Newly saved pictures don't show. Not usable on any of my devices in its current state: Tablet Android 4.2.2  Sony Xperia Android 4.3  Sony Xperia Android 5.0.,2
Love it Best app easy to use,2

Takes forever to connect Takes forever to connect to radio stations. While trying to connect  I switch to the BBC app   which connects immediately  and literally as much as 5 minutes later  not interrupts when it connects.,2

It's okay It works perfectly fine on my phone but on my tablet I put the files as well as where they need to be at and for some reason it opens up and it crashes before it even gets started. I have a Samsung s2 tablet,2

Good idea! But it just doesn't work no matter if all settings are enabled. I enabled 'Torchie Functionality'. Pressing and holding volume buttons does nothing when screen off (enabled). On lock screen or unlocked. I really like the idea. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? Samsung Galaxy Note 3,2
Bad update This update made me really upset. Many things are broken or won't work like they always did. For example: if I open a link from another app/shortcut on my launcher  it won't open and the browser will show the home page instead. Another bad thing imho is the impossibility to choose  when I open a link in a new tab  to open it on background. On old version this was possible and it would be nice if there's an option to bring it back like I described in this new one.,2
Too much hanging...,2

Features Removed :( Removed the ability to set the location of cached songs to the SD card with the latest update  now my 60GB of music on the card is useless :( Annoying,2
It doesn't have to be more complicated than this. News headlines and access to your local NPR audio stream below. If looks a little dated but I hope it won't be replaced by a fancy looking app that can do a lot of stuff I do not need. However  lately it has begun to play yesterday's morning news instead of today so the app is useless to me. Fix please!,2

I just made a donation to this app  but not happy now. Just noticed it is now no longer grouping my SMS into tidy conversations in my email when it backs up?? Instead  it appears to be sending each single text msg as a separate email?! With no option to group them anymore?! I will have to uninstall if I can't get the group-by-contact function working again!!,2

Unacceptably buggy Speech feedback frequently stutters or fails to work and sometimes plays audio through headphones and speakers. It also has trouble with volume  being much quieter than it should be. Perhaps the most frustrating part is trying to lower the notification shade. I frequently have to pull down on the shade 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or even 8 or 9 times before it descends fully. Of course I don't have a choice. I have to use it whether I like it or not since that's the only way I can interact with my phone,2

Thus  for me this app can't be used until this function is returned in a future update. Until playback speed adjustment is readded  I'll be using Maple Player Classic. I suggest that as an alternative to this player for those needing speed adjustment.,2

Ok Really awkward to use. Why does the puzzle hug the left side of the screen? You can rarely guess which clue it will jump to next. The clues don't stay in sync with which box is highlighted. You have to double tap a square to get it to go. And more.,2

UPDATED ON FEBRUARY 14  2014 More than 2 years since last update. Small file size. Should be removed. Tab S 8.4 Android 5.0.2,2
It want let me download this app I got a lot of space but it's just not working right,2
Bad,2
Doesn't work I put the bios in the correct places and it still doesn't work.,2
I update it already but what is the problem to update It again?why?again and again ....Omg ...,2
Doesn't work with Nougat? I have the correct bios files in the correct place  but no dice. When booting a game or even the bios on its own  the screen rotates to landscape and then just hangs indefinitely. I remember this app used to work flawlessly in the past  but since this hasn't been updated in over 2 years  I don't expect we'll see any fixes going forward.,2
crashed often connection to server is successful  but when I try to join a channel  it crashed.,2
Playlist is deleted EVERY TIME you close the app Since the update yesterday (august 2016) the playlist is deleted every single time you close the app instead of saved like it used to be in the past. it really sucks. I used this app daily for the last year /year-and-a-half  now I can't stand it because I have to re-queue every single time FIX IT PLEASE,2
It stops responding oftenly ..plz fix this,2
Doesn't work It hasn't worked once. It keeps getting stuck at 10% bootstrapping. It can't seem to connect to any servers.,2

Works sometimes Most times it doesn't update the wallpaper or will not change manually either. Pretty big bug.,2
Good Software,2
Not working,2
After l connect to a network why does it go really quick just cause l moved???,2
Change to a different because  lack of ability to create encrypted backup  app should have a pin lock  ability to use fingerprint or fido key for authentication.many use two devices so need to have ability to use on two devices. This app will start loosing users as now falling behind some very good free and paid apps  can't rely on the google name to keep users so start listening to your customers.,2
Also an useless app!,2
Dislike it,2

Amazing app with major problem I've been using it for a week now but didn't know what has been hogging up my battery so bad. Literally would drain twice as fast. I'm using the S4. The battery would literally drain without touching the phone charging. Besides that  its an amazing app.,2

Trying to like it  but... it doesn't seem to be deleting some photos. When I reboot or return from flight mode  previously *deleted* items reappear in their old position. If I delete them from explorer  they still show up in count/album cover  but when I enter said album  only blank tiles shows in their place  even after clearing cache. I think the issue started a couple of updates back. Nonexistent previously. Otherwise  very light and fast  refreshingly unobscured by useless (for a gallery app) options and honest with permissions,2

What can I do about the reboots? This has been my go-to method for playing music on my mobile devices for years. I love the server product (purchased long ago)  and the mobile app has always been great. However  since I upgraded my phone (T-Mobile Galaxy S4 - M919) to Kit Kat the app has been unusable for me. It works for a few tracks and then spontaneously reboots my phone. This happens when using wifi or mobile data connections. I've cleaned all of my settings  did fresh installs  factory reset my phone  formatted my SD card (although Subsonic is using the internal storage)  etc.  and I still get the reboots. I see that others are having this problem as well. I'd really like to find some information about how to resolve this. I rely on my Subsonic server heavily for music. This will be a 5-star review when I can get this resolved.,2
It work. But if I disconnect it  my phone won't connect to internet until I reconnect it or restart my phone,2
Used to like but now not so good I uses to love this app on my last phone  a rooted LG G2 however on my unrooted S6 edge it's useless  most of the features require root access and some of the ones that do work report in-accurate data making the app useless for me.,2
Like it but.... It doesn't change when it should. When I set my own pictures it doesnt let me choose from my gallery it brings me to some weird google drive page. I should be able to adjust what part of the picture I see on my home screen.,2
The app keeps crashing as soon as I tap the video recorder button. What gives!,2

Mobile Legend has problem with this app  fix it asap,2
This app has potential but has a long way to go. POSITIVES: - No ads - Easy to read - Ability to search 'open' tasks - Ability to prioritize tasks - Tasks can be quickly created - App tracks a lot of metadata for a task NEGATIVES: - Was not able to figure out how to sync tasks. Not very intuitive. - Not able to search completed tasks - Not able to manage tasks via a PC - The task completed time stamp is inaccurate - Cannot create recurring tasks - No task badges/notifications - Cannot import tasks from another task manager or spreadsheet,2

I've used this app for awhile and I have a large number of books. Mostly its fine  but they do not respond to emails when there is an issue. Even after following directions exactly when switching phones  my books were there but the covers are missing. I have nearly 1000 books so I'm not about to scan them again. If they were even a tiny bit responsive  they'd get a 5 star review  but I've emailed 3 times with NO RESPONSE.,2
Initially  it was good but later on i see error and blank text while open my email. Can't use now.,2
Update 4/24/2016- I'm changing my review from 5 stars to two  because the instant upload feature just stopped working. I took four pictures today while out and about and none of them will upload even now that I'm back at home on wifi. I didn't change anything but it just stopped working. I also took a pic before leaving the house while still on wifi  and that one never uploaded either. Hopefully they'll fix this soon. I will adjust my review if they do. Otherwise I'll be uninstalling. Works with OwnCloud! I'm using to sync with my raspi OwnCloud server and it's working great. I love that this app allows me to set it up so that photos taken on my phone go straight to my server  and sync with my computer's. No more uploading photos to Googles servers!,2

I like the concept but it isn't working with audiobooks. Downloaded today. It gave me an error (I have fedex tracking app that it was clashing with). Uninstalled fedex then had to install barcode reader  the first one didn't work so I removed that one and downloaded the other one. Tried scanning the barcode on audiobooks but it doesn't work. Tried it on an old textbook and it worked fine. I was able to type in the isbn and needed a wifi connection for it to find the book I was planning on using this to keep track of the audiobooks that I listen to but will be looking at other options.,2
Crash break And it keep repeating,2
should have a warning in-app definitely dont use this if you have adhd or really any neurological disorders of any kind  because that puts you at a higher risk of seizures and its really not safe. the warning/disclaimer should probably be displayed upon opening the app  as its not very common for people to go through and read the details.,2
Network Connection Problems I really loved it but since last update i am having Problems with Network Connections..... It always shows Connecting to Network even using WiFi and Full Network. i never had such problems in Whatsapp if you fix i will definitely change it to full Stars,2
Bad re-connection When the app can't connect to internet once  it doesn't even try again: have to exit and re-enter to make it work. Very frustrating. Also  no push notifications.,2
Cursor does not move to next clue at the end of line. Movement style options have no impact. Extremely frustrating as I have to click basically every clue.,2
Can't open settings... The app crashes every time I want to use settings. So i can't set up a Cyrillic font and therefore the app is worthless.,2
Its not better,2
Problems with the push notifications! I have to open the app to see if I have new messages😑,2
Tooooooooo bad,2
File browser doesn't work Can't display long filenames for files that isn't 'scanned'. Why?!,2
more power consumption i loved the app. I had no other choice but to uninstall it due to more power consumption. My battery life reduced to almost half. I could see over 20% constant usage of cpu by this app and frequent restarting of the app.,2

"Does what it claims; and that's the best that can be said. I don't have the time it would take to describe all the ways this app is disappointing. In order to adjust an antennae using this app you would have to have a pencil and paper to write down all of the station number translations during the 15+ minutes it takes to manually """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""scan"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" each individual station. Then manually type in the stations you want to tune/adjust in a tedious process of turn  type  wait  repeat. The alternative is to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""scan"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" them several times to make sure getting one station clear doesn't undo the tuning of another. This  of course  would take several hours if you live anywhere near a metropolitan area. There are 2 or 3 extremely simple UI enhancements that could make this """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""simple"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" app actually usable. Since this hasn't happened in the last year  I don't expect it anytime soon. For the love of all that's usable  couldn't you at least retain the list of tuned stations to scroll through?!

I decided to uninstall. I was unable to uninstall via the phone settings and part of the problem was that I allowed the app to run as a phone administrator. It wouldn't deactivate as a phone administrator. Had to uninstall from within the app by selecting the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" circle icon in the upper right and selecting the uninstall hyperlink.""""",2

great looking app  unfortunately it reliably crashes when using more than 2 programs at once and opening. for example if Pandora and jefit are being used and I open qksms it quits both Pandora and jefit. definitely needs to be fixed before I can keep using it. doesn't happen on any other texting apps I have ever used.,2

Major bugs/shortcomings LG G4 Android 5.1 1) App always downloads a very abbreviated version of a spreadsheet instead of the full version. Most of my spreadsheets apparently are too big  but there seems no way to just load the full file as the default. 2) The description says it can edit a file  but I found no way to do this and I'm not the only person who has this problem according to their comments on Facebook. Clicking the pencil icon says to make changes and then SAVE  but there's no way to make the changes.,2

This app is very useful  when you can use it and edit your site as you please. In order to access Themes and edit the website layout I chose I have to log in again  and then it doesnt even go through. In order to log in I have to recreate a password and log in  and then it does it again  the next time I want to make changes. This is ridiculous. Please change it.

If you disable a cpu core  it will stop auto control it had before  meaning it will stay on or off constantly if you set it so. Before you mess with it  you could see it turning on or off randomly. Another bug is zram. It just cant be disabled by default when turning on the device. Not everybody wants it. I dont want to make additional read write operations on my internal memory as it wears the ssd pretty much. Until then  this app is on my BLACKLIST. Im pretty dissapointed. Had to restart my phone to fix cpu cores,2

Works mostly but no more support or updates for YEARS I've been using this for years without a hitch until now. Used it on my old phones and it was one of the first apps installed on my Note 4. Set it up and forget it- just always worked flawlessly. The brightness control isn't fine enough to set the correct level after MM update. Yet another DEAD app in the Play Store with no support or development. Their website isn't even up any more. Just sell or donate the app to someone who will actually develop and support it!,2
After update Wow after the update got into the app and found all sorts of ringtones listed thought they were loaded junk started deleting till I figured out they were from my own phone like camara clicks and so forth luckily I did not delete something super important. I don't like scrolling through all the nonsence before getting to my music then when I do takes a long time to load. Gets stuck once it passes 98. Please fix and ill adjust rating.,2

Used to be great Alot of great features. However it has issues with email syncing and it can drain your battery unexpectedly.

Crashes a lot. Especially if going into settings then back to camera. Most of the time it doesn't actually ever take a photo,2
??? It's very neat but after a while it won't let me play anything on it. I have Samsung Galaxy S6,2
Version 2.8.6 indeed brought some improvements  but still so slow. It would be a great app (especially with this minimum permission) but speed is still an issue. Sometimes only a grey background is shown for seconds  could not load pictures quick enough.,2

Started out a good app. However now I can't download the songs off of the YouTube option. Also it quit searching songs,2
New update no functionality I used to love this app because it allowed me to save a playlist of stories even if they got removed. Ever since the update the Playlist feature just doesn't work at all once the app is closed and in every single podcast about 5 minutes in it rewinds about 5 seconds like some kind of glitch. I really hope they fix these problems because it makes the app pretty much unusable!,2

Fuckings apps,2
Can't find an exit button  streaming issues Good layout and easy to use. But streaming audio often stops playing without any reason  whether app is open or running in background. Also  there should be a way to close the app. I don't want the icon in my notifications all the time and its annoying to have to go to android settings to force close it.,2

Not automatically backing up Realized today that it hasn't backed up my text messages in 4 weeks  went to back up but it wants to back up ALL messages  not just the past 4 weeks. Currently 5 hours in and only backed up 3100 texts. I've looked and looked but don't see an option to back up since last update. Will be looking into other apps,2
It hangs too much,2

Not as good as WLD This app is good (4 stars)  but it is not as good as Wakelock Detector. Make sure you check out both before you PAY for this. I personally prefer WLD. In fact  you should try WLD first  since the FREE version has ALL the features except widgets and Knowledge Base articles. I find it very I disappointing that BBS does not offer a trial version. I bought it because I was hoping that it would give me further insight than WLD. It didn't  really. If I could  I would get a refund.,2

Meh  almost a successful app Not sure why takes up to two minutes to load audio over. Or why you have to turn it back on to load stories. Mostly garbage as far as apps go but I like the content  sometimes. But anything that let's me skip SOME national petroleum radio has to be better than nothing,2
It's weird It deletes all of your music for know reason,2
I love this app but I changed phone and I cannot import to the new phone the list of books that I exported from my previous phone. It is stored in my desktop. I wrote the developer to ask for help but he has not answered. Can anyone help me? (the rating is because I got no answer  otherwise it would have been a 5. I will change it if/when Evan answers my query),2

This is an OK app but it does have two issues. The first one is... it does Not offer automatic rotational viewing. So in other words  on my Samsung phones the content is displayed in portrait mode when my phone is charging in landscape mode. From what I can gather Dashclock uses the display mode that your phone is last on when it activates. So if your Homescreen is able to rotate like on a tablet  then no problem. However  if you're using a phone and your homescreen locks at only portrait mode then when Dashclock starts while you're charging... everything will be displayed sideways. The only way around that would be to open up any app that rotates  like Gmail for instance...then Dashclock will be displayed properly if your phone is in landscape mode. I did that until I found a rotational app that rotates my homescreen only when it's plugged in. The second issue/bug I found is a biggie. When Dashclock is running  it disables the swipe down to show notifications. When I first discovered this bug I thought it was my phone... but the problem only occurs when Dashclock is activated during charge....,2
It shows everything wrong,2

Ads are annoying  The content is great. It's why this is still on my phone. However  pop-up ads at the bottom of articles are too annoying  and I'm unable to close them on my Galaxy Note 4.

I believe the app has great potential  however on Android M with finger sensor  the Google lockscreen often requires a pin following the finger sensor read with AcDisplay with Active Mode enabled. It would be great to use the finger sensor with the AcDisplay and bypass the default lockscreen altogether from Active Mode. Visually  AcDisplay is a beauty and has some really nice functionality  however performance is unstable and the integration with the OS is not great.,3

I like it  but... a few things are annoying. 1) Why even have an online/offline mode  why isn't there just a check if a network link is up? Doesn't Android have that capability? I allways have to remember to switch back to online mode  or the sync won't work and the UI works differently depending on which mode i'm currently in. 2) Why does the creation of a random playlist in offline-mode sometimes take &gt;1 min. when it is instant in online-mode  whether i'm actually online or not?,3

Decent app  an issue or two. I struggle with insomniatic tenancies  I found the sleep induction worked exceedingly well for the first few minutes  only to be woken up when the app turned the background noises back on (I had them turned off as I found them distracting) the moment the track changes pace  to what it calls delta waves  the background noises were back and the slider still showed them as off. I had to turn the slider up and back down again to get them off  by which point I was back at square one. Needs some kinks sorted,3

Even on a large phone (LG Spectrum II)  I found the text output of the monitoring screen difficult to read. The app reminiscent of the old PC OS tools that reported everything the OS was doing. If the developer would use a more graphic oriented interface  it would be more useful to lay users. Other users complained that WiFi Fixer was a battery hog  however  I found using the settings to stop monitoring of services kept WiFi fixer from zapping battery life. However  this effectively reduces WiFi Fixer's usefulness. The developer should update the interface to specify which category of services to disable. For instance  disable monitoring screen handlers  app managers  but continue to monitor network activity. I found this app less than useful  but safe for my phone. The developer should consider updating the UI to a GUI  and add selective monitoring  and packet buffering to help stabilize connectivity  and well as a warning when the phone is switching from WiFi to carrier data  or when the WiFi signal is too low to maintain a connection.,3
Good but not suppot all games,3
Very good SMS app. Less relevant now that Signal is out.,3
Voice and video call? Status update and hold group chat message and click info to see read by who just like WhatsApp and also free voice call and video call! When telegram have it?,3
Better than the GoodReads app or mobile Once the pile goes past the three digit mark  batch edit and remove duplicates sort of become essential =) Also  syncs read books as want to read in GoodReads. Oops.,3

Much better,3

I think it will be suitable to me,3
It's ok,3
Compas doesnt work The compass doesn't work in this app. I don't have any issues with the compass in any other app. This doesn't have anything to do with the z-axis being reversed. It simply won't rotate more than 30° away from either north or south  depending on the z-axis setting. This is a longstanding issue which made the app difficult to use for years and the recent update didn't change anything about it.,3
It's okay Good. Lots of potential. Please don't abandon this app. Add more features.,3
Many Permissions Why do i want to update this app for other apps......,3
That's nice,3
No pictures when you fucus the phone on a constellation  there are.  Switching to another app  I am.,3
Needs some work User UI needs to be better organized and formatted. Not going to give details as it could use a complete do over. Also it always shows WiFi on most of the time what it's not,3
Offline doesn't work for long,3
Needs work No emogis and trying to change icon app colour makes app disappear from screen. Had to uninstall and then add again. Not sure how to make it the default SMS app.....not sure I'll bother though.,3
Does what it's supposed to do ? ? but there's room for improvement. What I'd love to see is the recognition of even more mime types (e.g. the Google Authenticator protocol isn't recognised). Also reading QR-codes from a bitmap would be a great addition because sometimes people share those with you and obviously you cannot scan them using the camera when the screen is part of the same device :-) Thanks!,3
Best app for auto wifi connection but.... I'm facing problem after I update to lollipop. The mobile data no automatically off after connect to wifi. Please help,3
I love this app but right now I'm always hesitant to click on links that leave facebook. Everytime I come back to the app  it's a white screen and looses my place in the timeline when j hit the back button. Please fix.,3
Ok for day to day... but remember to DISABLE IT BEFORE YOU MOVE DEVICE. I Lost all my android settings after the last android update as it reset my device. No way of getting the codes to log in. Can only verify by text when skipping the initial login  but then settings don't sync ie ringtones  alarms  backgrounds all gone. Also all third party authenticator accounts need to be recreated when you move device.,3
Not good app,3

Good but... It would be even better if you added a password lock feature to the lock screen. Also  make it so the lock screen doesn't disappear if you tap the home  recent tabs  or back button because I'd love to use this as my actual lockscreen. Do this and I'll give five stars! This locker is the best!,3

Ok but could be better 4/06/2012 - A little outdated in how it looks  could be better in describing how to setup ie actually give the option for push or manual sync. Add a schedule for when mail is synced and then give option to just manual sync etc outside of those times. These are only things tying me to stock! 23/4/2016 - same applies....only this time gmail fails to configure as the app doesn't comply with modern security standards...oh well..2nd attempt in 4 years ends in disappointment again..,3

Useful but needs work While it does indeed read .ODT and does a good job of it the interface is clunky and obscure. It takes a long time to open large files and appears to forget the reading position as soon as you switch to another app. It also has a weird way of zooming and wrapping text. Bottom line - it works but using it is far from pleasant.,3
Pretty impressive,3
Great,3

I don't know....but it seems quite bad that this app supports several European and West Asian languages but doesn't support South Asian languages like Hindi  Bengali etc. Would be better if such language choices are provided.

"Playlist support is very counter-intuitive. Just before I posted this review (which would have been very different)  I figured it out. To actually play a whole playlist rather than one track from it  you have to long press on the name of the playlist and then select play from a bunch of options in a list that pops up. Who would think of that? Poor UI decision there. You should either let people know how that works  or just put a big """"""""""""""""Play all"""""""""""""""" button beside each playlist in the list. The point is to make it convenient to fire up a playlist when you're on the go  not fiddle around with submenus. I very nearly uninstalled this because it appeared to be unable to handle .m3u playlists properly. Additionally  we NEED the ability to filter out folders that contain audio but not music. That's a serious flaw that any decent player has addressed long ago.""""",3

Adequate  but nothing spectacular. Difficult to transfer accounts from one device to another.

Works somewhat  but crashes repeatedly when scanning some QR codes When the app works  it works great; very easy to setup and use two-factor authentication. However  it repeatedly crashes while scanning some QR codes  which means it utterly fails in those situations. Even more  crashes caused by outside inputs are worrisome  especially in security apps. Right now it's just a denial of service  but could you fix it before someone makes it worse?,3

Mixed feelings I've played this game for a long time; i have partecipated in the online community. I enjoyed Andor's Trail  but i have some issues with it. some pretty BIG issues. First  this (very nice  very well written RPG) requires you to grind .. a lot. And to be honest  that's not entirely bad - it's a mobile-phone RPG  so the grinding actually comes useful at times  when you have a moment of boredom during your day  waiting for the bus  at lunch  or whatever  just open it  grind a few mobs  and put it back in your pocket. But you will need to grind quite a lot to advance in the story. Second  while the game is very nice ... it's not finished. NOWHERE near finished. It will never be. There's not been a single update in a whole year and there was ONE update in the year before that. I've basically been playing it since early 2011 and i've seen a two updates  one very minor  since. And that's a real shame  since the story and writing are so good. But after playing it basically every day for two years straight i just couldn't take it anymore and deleted it. Android is just not a good platform to build a full bodied RPG. Sorry guys  but honestly i can't be asked to wait forever.,3
Its really good I got more apps,3
"The app can only read barcodes when the phone is oriented at landscape mode. If the phone is in the portrait mode  the reading screen remains in landscape mode and I'm unable to read the code (when at the settings menu  the screen follows the phone's orientation  the problem is just when at the scanning mode). I already tried to change the """"""""""""""""no automatic rotation"""""""""""""""" option  but the problem persists. Had the same issue with Moto X 2nd gen (now with Galaxy S7E).""""",3

It's ok It plays all my ROMs no problem but is slow  slightly slower than the currently highest rated emulator  but that emulator also forces u 2 rate it 5 stars or u can't save. BTW don't tell me that it's slow coz my phone sucks  i have an 8x1.5Ghz processor  and i fiddled with the settings to speed it up,3
It's a okay app needs some improvements No comments thank you at this time!,3
It's ok Can't upload image or gif from the motorola x play or samsung s4 to the app. So it's like word press viewer 2.0. Need to fix that.,3
Very good app  specially with the NASA APOD plugin. The wallpapers are terrific  and I love the fact that the wallpaper stays blurred in the background until you double tap  at which points it comes into focus for a few seconds. Great touch  very slick. Highly recommended. *EDIT* I've noticed for several months now  the app has become buggy. Wallpaper doesn't update properly  the app crashes  and sometimes loads half a page... I stuck with it for months  hoping for improvement  but no luck. Sadly  I will no longer be using it. A shame  really.,3

Not Bad  But Has Volume Trouble This alarm does have some decent features  and so far seems reliable enough  but the volume of its alarm tones is controlled by the media volume in Android. That means that if you don't want to go deaf watching videos and listening to music  your alarm may not be loud enough to wake you up (assuming you're a heavy sleeper like me).,3

Works... until I reboot. Then I have to reflash the zip again. And once I boot into the desktop  it updates from the Play Store and says I have to update the binary... sometimes it works  but if I reboot again  it says the binary is out of date and I can't update it via recovery  it's as if I don't have root. Like I stated before  though  if I flash it again  it's working fine.,3

A few thigs need fixing. Back and forward buttons are a bit delayed. When back is press it should take you to where you were in the previous page  and not back to the top.

It's a hit or miss Has a pretty decent selection  only thing you can't preview the music you want to download. You have to just hope it's the right song.

* Please bring dual sim support so that I can rate 5(*)'s + EDIT: SMS over a pure LTE network does work. But letting me select which SIM its using to send a message is non-obvious though its possible/available * Add to that the requirement of this app needing to be the default SMS app is a little tedious. Hope google improves that if you guys cant work around it. * But even importing encrypted messages would be good enough for now which its not working right now.,3
It's OK but it's OK but it takes a really long time to download and a lot of time to update please make this a lot faster!!,3
It does its job I would love it if I could just swipe between different counters or if it kept track of where you were if you uninstall it get a new phone.,3
Almost there I've only tried older games on the emulator  and it's done an OK job. But it could do better. The games are still laggy and inconsistent  but it's still OK. But it's no surprise that it works as well as it does  since it uses the desume as a base. A lil more work and it'll be great. Hope to get a full fledged version in the coming update,3
Great but.... Video delayed and the save to external sd while recording does not work on xiaomi mi4i :(,3

Audio ducking still broken Despite version 4.4 claiming to have fixed it  audio ducking is still broken for me (app version 4.4  Nexus 6P  Android 7.0). While Subsonic is playing  if anything else plays a sound  like Google Maps for example  Subsonic still sets all system audio output to like 15%  instead of just its own output. Everything else is great  this is just a really frustrating (yet minor and easily fixable) bug  that really should have been fixed a loooong time ago.,3

It's ok For a stripped down version of fb it's great  there are a few setbacks tho...the ability to not be able to post a picture is a huge issue for me  as well  the copy paste function typically doesn't work and the spacing btwn words and paragraphs disappears.,3

Hiiii Hiiiii,3
It gives you a virus that you'll have to get an app to get rid of that,3
It's bad Very bad app,3
Doesn't support Marshmallow? I've been using fbreader for many years  on the Nokia N770 and Sharp Zaurus  maybe even on Windows CE. I'm sad to say that my time with fbreader may be at an end  at least until Marshmallow support is added. For both the internal memory and SD card  I get a permission denied error when attempting to access directories on them. Consequently  I can't open any books but the built-in help book. Looks like I'm off to find an alternative  hope that fbreader adds Marshmallow support soon!,3
I think its pretty cool Aop,3
Not bad,3
It doesn't have enough Some of the songs I want are not even on there,3
Looks great. No after hours updates? Would also like to be able to add commodities.,3

So slow Please add a fast forward button soon or I'll remove the app,3
It's need to update many times,3
Not quite there yet. Use RetroArch instead. It's free.,3
Good,3
Need to improve Nice app. ....,3
I was using this app relatively frequently  but after a factory reset I'm unable to install it correctly. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times but it just crashes instantly and won't open.,3
Pls update data backup facility in app,3
Touchpal tamil,3
Good but takes very big portion of my eam Ok it is good for 2gb to 4gb ram's mobiles,3
Goof,3
Now  this app is justifiable. But please  you need to make it smaller - many phones nowadays still don't have a lot of memory.,3
Mehhh  it has what I want  but hasn't let me actually download anything in months.,3
Why can't I get google assistants.,3
I prefer this app over the one's that let you listen to the song before you download because of storage consumption but would give a higher rating if I could listen first. Also I really do not like frostwire opening on many apps,3
Not what I needed I wanted to open a docx file  it didn't open... Maybe it only supports open office formats  but it's not what I needed,3
Update the app Make more Features be available in this android app.,3
Needs a lollipop update It works  but I can no longer cache music on a physical SD card  which is annoying and pretty much kills the usefulness of this app for me.,3
I can't zoom in or out like I used to be able to.,3

New UI but no new function Should it call new theme instead? Please at least let me rearrange display order. Update 11 May 2016: new version still can't rearrange ordering  is that so hard to implement?,3
It's great but... I would really like it if you could make the game work as I'd it were on the real thing with the sound on. Some of my games I would really like the sound on  so please consider!,3
Not 4 my phone This app scanned & repaired the first time  for 15-20 minutes. It did work  for a day. The second go-round  it couldn't fix my problem. I did like the fact it scanned thoroughly. I'm going to buy an upgraded phone & install this app on it.,3

Sort of works ok but restored SMS conversations have been divided into two threads per contact; one thread for messages sent and another for received. Looks messy and it's impossible to follow old conversations. Exactly the same issue as a rival app!,3
Scanner problems When i try to scan the code  the camera does not open ( or closes really fast )  so i have to input the code for new account manually. Any idea what is the problem?,3
I am unable to use 'select files' on my phone. This is really bugging me because it means I have to use a less convenient method to upload images for a header. Please fix.,3
For some reason this app is needed everywhere but you cant find it on playstore.,3
Nice but nt so much.....,3
Google play Average,3
Love the app. A few kinks that need to ironed out and a few laggy moments but by far the best sms app,3
"So far so good... Update 2: It's back. I can't repair it this time. I'm uninstalling (and sad about it). Do a Google search for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Muzei cpu"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - turns out it's common. PLEASE FIX! Update: Removed plug-ins (for good). Still used cpu. So I reset data and configured it again. Worked. OLD: It's running at a constant roughly 2%  screen on or phone sleeping. That's enough to make a dent in battery usage.

I'd like to use it but... Seems it doesn't want to accept my works email exchange account. Keeps saying a valid url for the exchange account could not be found.

"Edit: Still using K9 Mail. The most annoying thing about this app is deleting multiple emails. Rather than press and hold to enter into a """"select mode"""" where you then tap all your emails you want to delete  you have to press and hold each email and choose """"select"""". This takes ten times longer to simply delete multiple emails. It's rather painful amd annoying. All of a sudden I could no longer send email  only receive. I went to the server settings for outgoing mail  and clicked next and immediately got an error. I didn't notice at first  but after the update  www was added in front of my outgoing server. removed the www and it worked fine as it should. Thought I'd post this in the review section in case others come here with the same issue",3

It sucks to be honest u can't find new songs😒,3
Great app  I having been using for a good while on Android 5.0  but since upgrading my phone there is no proper Android 7.0 support  will give higher rating once the issues of not finding the DB and key file and not being able to update the DB have been fixed for Android 6.0 and higher.,3

I hate to be that guy  but... This app isn't nearly as useful if you don't have root access. My fault for not reading the fine print before purchasing. Still useful  but I can only use about 1/4 of the features.,3
Excellent gallery  but latest updates slowed loading of photos,3
It is very good Nice I like it good good good and carry on,3

I post most of my updates on the go via my phone so now I haven't posted updates for 2 weeks Feeling really frustrated and don't know what to do. I sent emails 2 weeks ago to you still no reply.,3

displaying pictures randomly. even after i unchecked that box. i selected some images. but it will select all images (with some i don't wanna use as wallpaper). please fix. this is an awesome app.,3
Its OK but When I finish the library download there are no words for peeked just 0's,3
Good app Works well but the main problem is that when using an addon like mp3 streams with Kore you cannot Press enter or arrows on the pop ups on the remote device. If it worked id give it 5 stars. Update...Reading other reviews I have to go back and select the remote device against for the arrows and enter to work..otherwise after selecting an artist Kore just says connecting. A bit of a pain and am sure a simple update will fix it...but still 3 stars...,3
Please change the app icon. It looks very old,3

Try to make it more user friendly because it crashed imedeatly but it is not to hate STALKER=ME,3
Needs a widget Other auth token apps seem to all have widgets so it isn't necessary to open the full app to get your code. Really wish this app had a widget as I find it irritating to have to open the app every time I need a token.,3
very slow this is very slow running,3
It's perfect... But has a very risky bug! When selecting multiple images for deletion... It sometimes deselect the selected images and select some random nearby images in their place....,3
Crashes After the new update it keeps crashing whenever I delete any file and change the color of the layout. Please fix it,3
It does a good job at identifying colors It does a pretty good job at identifying colors and has a clean interface that makes it easy to use. My only complaint is that the camera is rotated 180 degrees on my phone. That makes it difficult to point at specific objects.,3
aungaung aungaung,3
It has potential I gave it a 3 even though the movement square by square annoys me enough for a 1. This game has a lot of potential just like many others that are similar emerging like this. But when your trying to get somewhere fast over and over again the one square movement drives you nuts and interest in the game drops. Then the uninstall. Also i don't have time to register in a forum every time I have an improvement idea. I'll leave this on my desktop for a lil while in hope some corrections for smoother performance is,3
Needs attention and quickly Manages to block some ads  but a lot still get through. Does not save passwords very annoying. Does not clear history properly either  chrome is starting to look good again.,3

Good App Great app for planning your routes if you are very careful tapping. No way of deleting a wrongly tapped way point or dragging it to where it is needed. Basically have to start again with a new route. VERY VERY irritating due to lack of deleting and clearing the displays. However I can put up with it and better than anything else. Dave,3

Has great potential  but needs polishing There are some balance issues (e.g. Dual Wield is overpowered compared to other fighting styles). It'd be nice to have cloud save (on Google account). Otherwise  sooner or later  one will lose the save. I'd also fix issues with Temporal Magic AKA save & load cheat.,3
Errors in code Than I will install poot root I get error in code 18 please help me,3
Useful but annoying If this app isnt updated  youtube nor any other google app can run. Its so annoying to have to delete my games only to update this.,3

Calibration needs work. Perhaps some way of calibrating the map by focusing on the moon to orient it? Because unfortunately the map is frequently offset with the location of things in the sky. I understand it must've been terribly difficult to get it even this accurate  but perhaps by doing this it'd help bypass compass and magnet issues.,3

More LibraryThing connectivity  please. Seeing as they obviously have a relationship with LibraryThing - I don't see why I can't upload my collection information already entered into LibraryThing!!! Why only goodreads!!!! WTF!!!!! More LibraryThing connectivity like being able to upload my collection info would be nice. Other than that - app does what it says it does  so i guess its all right.,3

"Too Easy To Read With the bright white screen it's easy for anyone to read your """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""secret"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" code  even from across the room. With the timeout on the right side and the code on the left  it takes a lot of eye movement to find the account  check the time left  then view the current token. The app is badly laid out. You cannot reorder accounts  so add them into the app in priority order. Luckily there are other apps like Authy which perform the same function.""""",3
useless i didn't know how to use it...i can't change another account to my clash of clans online game.,3
Fine app just going to try,3
Update downgraded app You can't find new files by refreshing because there is no refresh option  only search. And now it takes untold seconds for the songs to load whereas before they played instantly. The functionality seems to be non-existent. I wish I hadn't updated. :/,3
Update The new update has you go directly from the app to the webpage instead of being able to make changes through the app itself. Has its downfalls if using a tablet or mobile device.,3

Hard work This app is ok. The end results can be great if you are patient  but the whole interface is just painful  and I end up putting off updating my blog because I know it is going to be a hassle. There seem to be so many different areas to the app  all of which allow you to edit a post for example  but each with a slightly different interface and different features and options. Yesterday I was previewing a post  found a mistake so clicked edit and went into a completely different editor  which allowed media insertion direct from hard drive rather than having to upload to library first. And now I can't find it. Could be great but is too messy and bitty. Typical piece of software written by a large company with lots of developers who don't talk to each other  and no one person with an overview of what it is really like to use.,3
Do like but .... Data hungry I like K9 and wanted an email client for accounts separate from Gmail etc.  but this service has used what I consider to be higher quantity of mobile data compared to other services. It's set to minimum demand but still too greedy  so regrettably will be removed for something more lightweight.,3
Google Messenger Compatibility It would be great if you cold make it so when it you click on the text notification it will take you to Google Messenger if that's set as your default texting app.,3

It is not bad,3
GRATE Start 1st off I waited a few weeks to test it out before doing this write up I found a few problems in the core of the setup of it  when a user dos not send his key ID with the encrypted file it will not do a search for a good key (GPG and PGP do) I do not send Key ID with messages for safety reason and not all pgp messages I send are in stranded E-mail when the key ID is not there it thinks it is a PW protected and dos not check for the keys. (That should be fixed ASAP) I also would like to see a way to do more advanced configurations like you can with most desk top client. Both those things are big deals with me. For that it is only a 3 star. Removed one star for each problem I had. Do not let that make you think this is not a good thing to use though. I still do. I need to know one thing not tested as of now but when certifying keys can you pick the certification of the key? and add notes to the cert? (Both of those things I would like to see too if it is not there) I do use a key policy URL so I would like to use it on the phone app too if possible. Thanks for bringing GPG/pgp to our phones.,3
It's ok,3
Good Nice,3
This app was great  until the new update which seems to have removed the sweep feature. Please consider bringing it back! I find it very useful for working out what's left  rather than having them ticked.,3

It doesn't save my draft when I switch to another app  my writing suddenly disappear.,3

What happened This use to be the most reliable app,3
Still struggling to find all folders. Sort by 'date taken' not working. Love the concept and the minimal permissions. This would be the replacement for QuickPic except for one issue - it doesn't display all of my photos - about a third of my pictures are missing from their folders  (.jpg and .png). They are shown by other galleries  and shown by Simple File Manager from the same developer. EDIT▶Since v2.3.0 finding all the pictures in each visible folder  with correct picture counts  but not showing all folders (they are not hidden). I've noticed that if I use a file manager to select a picture file from a folder that Simple Gallery doesn't show  and choose to open it in SG  after this the folder miraculously appears in SG with all its pictures. Sort by 'date taken' not working.,3

Good but the UI isn't for me Navigating the puzzle was clunky at times. I'm not a fan of the general layout of the puzzle/keyboard. The settings are nice and give you the ability to customize.,3
When I import a bunch of Pgn files into a new database  it won't save the games to the database. Initially  you see all the games  but if you open another database all the games disappear.

It doesn't always send you notifications right away when someone messages you even though I have it set up to notify me in the settings. Sometimes it doesn't notify me that someone sent me a message from up to 1 to 6 hours later. I have to keep checking back to see if I got new messages and that is very annoying. Other than that everything else works well.,3

Best flashlight concept Your work is best but it has some bugs. Sometimes when even I press single vol button  it turns ON (when screen off) and it sometimes also turns ON automatically when screen ON. And please add a notification icon when flashlight is on because sometime user don't know that the light is on and when someone tells that your phone's LED is ON  its embarrasing. Fix the two issues n I'll give 5 stars.,3

Sometimey for searching. One day you can find an artist  the next day  a simple search of their name turns up nothing. Good app regardless  have used it the last year or so to download music.,3
Really useful if it worked... It's a brilliant idea... But the app doesn't work... The accessibility gets automatically turned off which makes the app useless... I keep on turning it on but it turns off after sometime...,3
Useful but needless because all Google Apps should be in one all in app not 25,3

Works okay  missing features... Works fine  would be awesome to have a mouse function (an older Google TV Remote app had it) and a keyboard for searching. With those 2 small features it would easily make this app a 5 star. Thank you XBMC!,3

This app is really great about usefully and design  but sometimes I need to check my flash cards from my watch not just on the smartphone!,3
Nice but..... There should be a alarm reminder option where I control when the alarm sounds for each task like most calendars have. I want to be able to place a alarm reminder BEFORE the task starts to remind me not to forget to start the task. Not remind me right when the task actually starts as that's too late! Put this in the next update & I'll give it 5 stars.,3
It does not let me post my articles. Every time I click post  it says that an error has occured. Hope u'll take notice,3

Will be 5 stars with the old address search. New text search is cool for some tasks  but I can't set specific city\country and its terrible. Please return the old way to search address as an option (especially considering that old address search interface is available while routing). It would be awesome to get access to both search methods!,3
Very good ui  fast browsing and doesn't lead lag but... As I said very good app but we can't open the hidden websites in the deep web even when orbot is activated. So please fix this(or it doesn't have this feature yet?)  thanks.,3

Getting better  still buggy Doesn't seem to force close much anymore but still skips stories on the playlist sometimes and starts them about 3/4 of the way through.,3
Its great it helps talk to people faster,3
Continuing audio problems App is nicely designed  but audio streaming continues to be problematic across multiple streams/stations. Live streams cut off every 10 to 15 minutes on average - frustrating.,3
Questions The idea of this is great  but I'm confused on a few things. First  it won't let me select two times in one day for things such as brushing teeth and washing my face so I have to create two separate bullet points- one for morning and one for night. Also  you can only have one list? Why can't you have a list for daily habits  weekly habits  bi-weekly  monthly  or a list for things that have a deadline or need to be completed by a specific time/ date? I'd love it if someone could respond. Thanks!!!,3

Not so good,3
Simple but needs ability to swipe between lists Heavily relies on a hamburger menu & needs ability to swipe between counters. Other improvements could include negative counting  grouping of counters  counter interactions (e.g.  2 counters can be linked & a rule set so that when the first counter reaches 10  the second counter increments by 1). Otherwise  this is a good simple material design app with multiple counters & even a dark mode!,3
NEEDS FIXING Great idea for a app and everything works but you can't have a password on for it too work. That is stupid. I really want to use it but there's no point since I need to protect my phone.,3
Good  but not great. Couldnt really ask for more features but its really laggy on my galaxy s4,3
Just ok. Not better than the website which an App if supposed to be.,3

Great  but can not be trusted. This app is awesome in a software engineering point of view. But people behind it don't care to be responsible and act professional. They don't bother to explain their encryption and answer to many security experts complaints. Use it BUT not for sensitive informations  specially if you are in Iran or Russia.,3

"Can i ask something about this app. It's because when i downloaded it  it said it was free but is it really free just asking and if isn't well i am sorry because i don't know how to pay you back.

Very Complex Even after reading the faqs and by setting mode of billing by trial and error  i am unable to get correct stats. This app needs a easier interface specially for dual sim phones. My operator charges my calls by per minute. For eg if i called someone for 30 seconds  i will be charged for 1 minute. If i call for 1 minute 12 sec  i will be charged for 2 minutes. Now tell me what settings i need to do under mode of billing or anywhere else  so that i can get correct minutes i got charged for. Will rate 5 after.,3
Good Good nice and easy to use.... But I can't use the series option. Any help????,3
OK,3
Nice app,3
Nice,3
The call log on the LG G5 is not backing up correct. It only seams to backup what/when it wants. An option for a selected date range restore would be helpful. It would be cool only restore a day's worth of messages if using sim in multiple devices. When I switch phone I could just restore the messages I missed. Thanks for your continued development.,3

Why a separate app Can u add it in the Google app so it is integrated? Thank u,3
Love it but... I love this app. Really fits well with my phone's theme. However  it seems that the checkbox for the standard theme does not really exist in android 6.0. Hope you can fix it. Also  when you swipe an item to the left or right  the button for deleting or marking an item as done disappears quickly  so they're pretty much useless. And I also hope that you will allow editing the names of lists in the app. Will be giving 3 stars for now.,3

Good puzzles  buggy app I was loving this app  until the past few days when it started misbehaving. Now the text size of the puzzle grid will randomly shrink sometimes  so small that I can hardly read it. Double tapping to zoom works for a moment.... Until you type in a box and then it shrinks again. This is so infuriating! Any help would be most appreciated.,3
Almost perfect All this needs is a pin option and the ability to set a custom wallpaper and this is the best lockscreen replacement app out there.,3

Functional with irritating flaws Generally works as advertised. What I find irritating is any post beyond a certain length (about xx characters) and editing becomes frustrating because the text window is but a narrow slit. Also  though this may be a larger issue.

I love the app I've this app for over a year and love it. But lately it's crashing and now it won't let me set the wallpaper. I'm in an endlos loop of activating and setting the wallpaper.,3
Good,3
Please stop crashing!!! I'd consider myself a fairly light user  just want to do text and pics with captions on my phone as I have no PC access. Adding the pics is a nightmare: I've lately been using the multiple picker  but it doesn't recognise albums  and its very clumsy to scroll through thousands of pics. Have a workaround for that  but then changing btw apps or just scrolling up and down in editing mode results in a crash sooner or later. At my wits ends. I refuse to add pics one by one in the media library...,3

It plays games  but it's far from perfect. The graphics aren't too great and the game controls cover 90% of the bottom screen. I'm sure there is a way to change this (yes I'm aware I can remove the controls by clicking touch  but then they're not there at all)  but there is no way for me to access the app's options (thats if there are any  which would really surprise me if there was not).,3
Great but a few problems on locations I used this for astronomy research during a full moon   as the moon was right in front of me  yet on the sky map it showed that the moon was under me. Also   if possible   please add some more names of the constellations. Other wise good.,3
Buggy Great app if the session save() restore() and playback() worked. Unfortunately it doesn't restore and playback saved variables  which makes the app useless for me,3
Sync turns off under Android 6.01 Despite wifi set to 'on' when my two devices sleep  and power saving set to automatic (3 days of no use before the app is not allowed to run in the background)  sync turns off within an hour after both devices go to sleep. It can only be turned on by clearing the app out of memory and restarting it. Very annoying. It never did this under Android 5.x.,3

App's as fantastic as the developer is moody... The way Grarak's responded to this whole ordeal has left a bad taste in my mouth. I know us lowly users aren't the most eloquent folks but ffs  the majority expressed that they weren't feeling the new UI  boo hoo. As a developer  you either stick to your guns and say fcuk em or you take the feedback/criticism into consideration in order to provide a better UX going forward  depending on your philosophy. You can spare me the butthurt and the 'if you guys stroke my ego enough I might continue development'.,3

"Works fine for blocking unwanted """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""conventional"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" traffic. Custom scripts can be useful to block annoying stuff from ES File Explorer for example. However AFWall+ cannot give 100% guarantee to block all traffic. Voice recognition can get through the net and run successfully (as shown in account audio activity) while all outbound traffic is disabled by AFWall+.

I found one problem sorry. The app is unable to adjust to the weird screen size of my htc one m9 which was built to allow an extra centimeter of display.

Works alright  but no port rules  no wildcards and no global (pre-) filters are a huge PITA.

Meh I cannot get beyond the fugly UI. I am pretty old school so it is not that the UI is outdated. It would have been called awfully ugly 20 years ago. All those blocky letters in different colors makes me think I am looking at a shareware program from 1995. On the plus side  it did setup my Yahoo account easily. However  there should be a choice where to store the emails and not just downloads.,3
Uh ohh The apps not letting me look at my messages and it's telling me to use messenger. I've used this app for awhile never had any problems,3

Ok  but but limited means of dealing with errors Added fields for a new table  but an error in default value for a date field prevented table creation. The problem I found was that I couldn't edit the problematic field without first deleting all field defs after it.,3
Calm down everyone You mentioning the problems with the update is good but scolding the developers for your inconvenience is bad . This was a real time bug which the devs could not foresee . It happens and they are even sending updates for the past 2-3 days to solve it . Frankly I don't see a problem with the edit message update it saves a lot of idiotic messages sent by mistake. And yes even I lost fingerprint option   but they are actively solving it . Just calm down and let them do it without you hurling insults. Peace out,3
Sounds like bullshit,3

It works great Great app,3
"When trying the Android app (with offline map pack for the UK) today when using the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature I encountered two bugs which make using the app an incredibly frustrating experience: * When in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode the app does not keep the screen awake so after the phones """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""period of inactivity"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is reached the screen is switched off. This is incredibly frustrating as I had my phone in a case and I had to take it out of the case to switch the screen back on. * When in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode and using the offline maps if you switch out of the app (i.e. using the task switch button in Android) and back into the app the maps completely disappear  the route is still visible (i.e. the lines) but everything else is gone. The only way I've found to fix this is to stop """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and start it all over again! I found this issue due to the previously mentioned issue where the screen would turn off. When I switched the screen back on and went back into the app the maps were gone. I would appreciate if the developer(s) of the app could fix this as the bugs mentioned above make navigation using """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" a real painful experience.""""",3

Works good Alright. So this app worked good  then I got updated to KitKat and some of the functionality was lost. Eventually  I rooted... but this app soft bricked my phone not long after it booted up. I granted it root permissions and it froze up my phone until I uninstalled.,3

"Asking for people to buy Please stop with the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""thank you for using three of my extensions please consider buying......""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. WHEN USING LOCK SCREEN FUNCTION WITH PASSWORD CAMERA WILL NOT OPEN. If you want to use the AcDisplay lock screen and a pin  you simply enable AcDisplay on top of your stock lock screen. However  when opening camera from an off display using volume button shortcuts  AcDisplay will be in your way. Also  when using the AcDisplay camera shortcut  you will have to enter your pin before being able to use the camera (versus being able to use camera from the lock screen with the stock lock screen). 2. PHONES WITH FINGER SCANNERS MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. Many phones such as the Honor 5x  Honor 8  Nexus 5x  and Nexus 6p have a fingerprint scanner that allows you to go from an off display directly to the home screen when your finger is scanned. You cannot do this with AcDisplay  as the AcDisplay lock screen will open up every time your phone is unlocked.,3
Has stopped working since Lollipop update Really love this app but since I updated my HTC One M7 it won't load  just crashes out after the Scumm logo. Hope it gets fixed in an update as I miss playing the non Directors cut of Broken Sword.,3

You need to put a pasword option I have a note 4 and the aplication works great (without a lock) so when i do put a lock on it  and open my phone it takes me to my original lockscreen.. Otherwise the app is great.,3

Add secure lock option please,3
Haven't tried it yet... But is it possible to download the data (gb/s) of the app to the sd card?,3
Perfect but for one thing This app is perfect  except for the repeat function being on by default  it should be off. Once that is fixed  5 stars.,3
Issues not related to CoC Installed this app to add my dev site to my hosts file. Phone is rooted  app gets permission from SuperSU  my changes show up in the list  but if I refresh the list or close and reopen the app  anything I entered is cleared. Not sure if this is an issue with the app or my phone (ZTE Concord 2)  but all my other rooted apps seem to work fine. 3*'s because the app interface is simple and straightforward ,3

I get so tired of these apps prompting to do an update  and then after i do it  the app doesn't work right anymore. bad product from app makers. apps are so disappointing. I give up updating any more EVER. UPDATE: i appreciate your reply TY! i will use the browser version  it's quite fine. Wordpress itself is awesome  just a problematic app i guess.,3
Limited success It seems to be a very good application  but I can't seem to find any VNC'S or LO'S for Canadian airspace. If the creators add Canadian content  I'd be more than willing to give it a fair rating and share it amongst other Canadian pilots. Keep up the solid work.,3

Love it  except... The app is wonderful except for one thing. I would like pinch to zoom in/ zoom out capability. I like the text small when I read at home but I need it much bigger when I'm in the car or on the train. Zoning text as it is now takes forever so I keep my text between both preferences. It's a work around.,3
Nice... It makes work easy,3

Just another form of Google's market strategy  its cool i get it. Its all business,3
Just donated and trying out... I just donated and am trying out features  etc. Rating adjustment  up or down  pending more usage. So far looks promising and more intuitive compared to other similar apps I've used  but jury not yet reached verdict. Donated because I know very well the long hours a good developer invests in application... so I don't mind skipping a Coke or cup of coffee to support the dev's hard work! So  to all you haters & lazya_s complainers wanting all for nothing  do something to improve the world or SHUT UP!,3
Very pretty customisations possible but I wish there was a way to view tasks as well as events from the synced calendar... also there should be a tick off system for done tasks and a way to delete tasks.,3

Had a nasty Ad pop up that wouldn't let me go until I had to totally close this browser. We need hard core Ad blocking protection  seriously.,3
Great  but cant hear the game Where i can enable sound or something  theres no setting at all  the games runs well but i cant hear the game,3
Overall  I enjoy the app  but there are several bugs that hold it back. Every so often  the selected tile will move down one on its own  or the zoom will decrease slightly for no reason. I've also become aware of the screen flickering very quickly while a crossword is open. I'm not sure if this is a new thing  or if I've only just now become aware of it.,3
Ok for small quantities Failed repeatedly when I tried to restore all of my 17000 messages  but worked fine when I limited it to 500. Would be nice if it had an option of 1000 or 2000  because I don't need my texts from 3 years ago but more than 500 would be good.,3
It misses a lot of features. There should be a material design revamp  and an option to load user settings  ad blocking and more theming styles.,3
Screen overlay detected.,3
Tested app Good,3
I hate this update! One of the things I loved was different folder for photos and videos when auto uploaded. Now they all are in the same place. As all other apps.,3
Nice app  I am missing support for YouTube playlists  support for YouTube addon (search YouTube etc...) rolling back to Yatse but you are on the good way  interface is nicer in Kore!,3
good i like it,3
Every single app won't run without this one...,3
Great app Some features are not working on Android 6.0.1  Im not able to set download speed limit thru this app. Also  sequential download option is nowhere to be found.,3
Enough,3
Just one big fix! This app has so much potential! The idea is brilliant  and it works like a charm. There's just one huge issue: the marker size. I have absolutely no idea how the sizing works. There's no way of knowing which end you're working on  not to mention the fact that you can't tell whether it's getting larger or smaller. I most often wind up crashing only to realise that I'm at size 128 on the wrong end when I come back.If we could only put in the numbers numerically  this would be five-star in a heartbeat!,3
"Pretty good! My only major gripe is that this app usually screws up when being resumed  with an error saying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Error during communication. Check your connection"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Quitting and restarting always fixes it  the connection is not the problem.""""",3
keep updating... this is the fourth update for the same version...,3

Gets the job done  but nothing fancy No zoom is a bit frustrating. When I create a bookmark and then later try to use the bookmark to go back to where I was  it crashes. If I go to a different app and then later go back to this one  it starts from the beginning like I opened the file for the first time. Might need to look for a better comic reader... Just found Challenger Comics Viewer....much better. Truth.,3
Needs to update it database,3

Podcasts don't work great. I go on long drives frequently and will put several podcasts in queue to listen to. Nearly always somewhere about 20-30 minutes in it will just stop and go to the next one in the queue. It's really annoying to have to go back and find the right spot especially if I'm driving. Please fix this. I ♥ listening to Radiolab and Ted Radio Hour in the car!,3
It is ok for me,3
This is really nice,3
Good app,3

Promissing  but a mess in essential stuff Very light on space/memory  honest and essential with permissions  fast loading and simplistic. Developer  however  has messed up the app's ability to delete photos; it doesn't work on SD stored photos  only works for internal storage. EDIT: Added one star for developer's will to look into and resolve the issue.,3
Aung 619,3
A bit too hard There's some great additions to PD here but a few of the changes make it harder to the point where it's less fun. For example overweight weapons and armor are now worthless - what's the point of them being equippable when you're strength is too low. Strange choice. Artefacts and quest improvements are great though.,3
Great app  but the latest update has removed the stop option You need exit for all kinds of reasons  such as when I want to use one of the SIP accounts on another device  or to save battery. Now we have to go through the phone settings menu just to stop the application. BRING BACK THE EXIT COMMAND.,3

Gallery/QuickPic replacement with strange flaw Love the concept and the minimal permissions. This could be a replacement for QuickPic except for one issue - it doesn't display all of my photos - about a third of my pictures are missing from their folders  (.jpg and .png). I can see no pattern as to why it ignores them  they are shown by other galleries  and shown by Simple File Manager from the same developer. Also  if a new folder with pictures is created  it is not shown at all. EDIT▶Latest version shows missing pictures  but the folder picture counts are incorrect - they're not equal to the number of pictures displayed in each folder  but show the same number as before this update. Also some folders are not shown -maybe because those folders have an incorrect zero picture count?,3
Why so much lag opening the app? It was too much for me  uninstalled.,3

New update causing direction switching Loved this app for a long time. The only problem I'm having with the new update is that when I fill in a word in one direction  say across  when I try to double click another box to change to down  it will wait a second then switch back to across for some reason. Very frustrating and is causing unnecessary errors in my puzzles.,3

"Should read battery_current_now  not battery_current I seem to be on a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""quest"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to find any app/widget/piece of software that will do one simple task: read the battery current sensor in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""relative real-time"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - that is  as the CPU scales up and down  GPU kicks in and out  4G modem does its dance  and as all the little things of the system do their work  I can see the immediate response in the current that is MEASURED BY MY PHONE'S SENSOR. It has a sensor. It doesn't need estimation. It just needs an app that'll read /sys/class/power_supply/battery/battery_current_now without delaying 10 seconds for statistics logging or because it thinks it'll only update that fast. I can open a (non-root) shell and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cat /sys/class/power_supply/battery/battery_current_now""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  and it'll show me a new value each time  as often as I run it  multiple times a second. Why can't an app do that? Even when I select """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""1"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for the refresh interval (which would be adequate  but still slow)  the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""last updated"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" timer ticks away  but the value stays the same. This means the app is reading """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""battery_current""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  not """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""battery_current_now"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (I tested that - """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""now"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is real-time).

Tried uninstall and reinstall - the app would open but wouldn't run and displayed no information at all  until I manually set permissions relating to screen overlay. I certainly don't remember having to do that in the past. But the reinstall didn't change the problem regarding no updated statistical information  which problem persists.

Keeps posting?! Really cant stand facebook  the app  and the majority of creatures that live in that weird world. But it seems updates need to be made by us to several profiles. We love this wrapper  but would like to see the ability to upload an image. Plus for some reason whatever we post (update  comment) gets posted 10 times..... unfortunately.... we only notice when one of us logs in from a desk/laptop. For just checking  without getting notified of every breath taken by your friends  it is fab!,3
This app made phone camera stuck and wanted a restart. Android 2.3.7  Nexus One. As I was going to use the code this made me think twice. Let me know if you have any idea.,3
Great apps Just send you a report. I dont know a reason why I could not open my form after I did Get Blank Form in Odk 1.4.7. Its always crush and even refresh my OS.

Cannot pass parameters Doesn't have the ability to pass parameters to activities. Can't set custom activity actions - would be good to have presets for common actions such as android.intent.action.VIEW. Without this the usefulness of the app is reduced. Starting activities is also possible with many custom launchers such as Nova Launcher but they don't provide the option to set parameters either.,3

Meh It works alright for a free emulator  but my experience with it has been less than noteworthy. Your mileage may vary  but I found it to be laggy and slow  but playable. Until it glitched out and froze. May have been the game I was playing  but I decided the emulator wasn't worth my time. Again  your experience maybe different.,3
Review Its good,3

Please add these features A Ctrl+Z or undo feature & Recycle bin for deleted posts. I've had to retype my blog 4 times now because the app wiped it clean twice  the third time I was copying half the story and it cleared it instead. I'm now typing in Google Keep to avoid any further hours lost!!,3
Works quickly  and was accurate up to a point. I actually didn't notice any problems until several pages in. For some reason  while coverting an all-text PDF  it would break at the end of a certain paragraph  skip a page and a half or so  and pick up again at the beginning of another page.,3
good goodnest,3
What… What is the file's name??? I will give 5 stars once I know!!!,3
Minor additions would be good Ability to alter duration of programs would be great. Sound also jumps/skips if I open another program then go back to the app.,3
Keeps updating but I don't see any changes,3
Not responding,3
The game is exellent. Sadly it is unfinished the last update is around 2014.,3
It ok Heh,3
Few issues Can't see all installed apps in the App Manager. I've given permissions but still no use. Also  when moving (cut) something  the app seems to copy the file instead of moving it. HTC One M8 on Marshmallow. Please fix. Thanks.,3
After last update.. Messages in secret chats gets deleted every now and then..I get delayed messages..now when a message comes it there is no notification tone at all. Phone only vibrates. Settings all checked. Please do something,3
It doesn't allow other apps to install,3

"Recent update means that gmail has issues when one turns of body sensor permissions to google play. Google customer service teams have said that this is down to google play services permissions rather than gmail. A few peeps grumpy about this. Google play services team  could you please talk with the gmail team if you haven't already. I still like you  but appears play services is causing gmail to not """"""""""""""""fail gracefully"""""""""""""""" regarding permissions. Thanks in advance""""",3
Please make it personal. There are many great stories and I want to save them. I make a playlist  but after I turn off the app  they all disappear. I like NPR News but it can be better. Thank you.,3

Samsung Galaxy S4 This is a great app for backing up all SMS messages and call logs. But it is not backing up MMS nor is the auto back working. This is despite having auto backup set to 30mins  yet nothing was backed up for several days until I did it manually. This app used to work flawlessly up to about 6 months ago but now it's almost a joke.,3
Really useful. For the most part. I had an easier time going through to the Elder Hall and even prepared myself for each quest. I just wish that the Armour Builder function worked. I tried to put a piece of armour  but it was still blank. Please fix it. Some of the event equipment don't tell me what materials I need to make them. Please update app.,3
Its OK not too good,3

For some reason the background only plays a 5 second music then shuts off while voices stay on the whole time  it used to play both throughout the whole session. Fix that 5 stars please this was my favorite app. :/,3
Thank you,3
Don't like the new update The app keeps crashing and closing without warning. This is very frustrating. Miss the black keyboards and the arrows that used to be on the keyboard. I don't mind it being white  but it would be nice to have the old format back. Please fix!,3
why it doesn't closed? every time I closed it again will be open!my cell phone is nexus 4 android 5.1.1,3

It is okay  but the old XBMC Remote had a functional File Browser. The Music File Browser in Kore shows some random names for the folders that don't look at all like the file structure that I have. The search does not work  at least for Music. I end up using a computer with a music player to find my songs. If the search and File Browser would work it would be 5 stars!,3
App size too large. Should be below 5mb for the purpose it serves.,3

The hunger mechanic is the opposite of fun. There is enough food on each level to sate your hunger once  the problem is that you are constantly hungry. It's meant to add challenge  but really it just makes the game not fun.,3

Good but... Could you add more kpop songs? Especially BTS EXID TWICE RED VELVET GOT7 APINK MISSA I.O.I BIG BANG 2NE1 4MINUTE GFRIEND SISTAR etc.? I promise I'll rate this app 5 stars.

Blue light filter is NECESSARY guys!!! ' App works grt  interface is good feels advance but you are missing the most important BLUE LIGHT FILTER.It is a must have feature for these kinda apps!!!,3
Needs Work 1) Being that my device is rooted  I set in preferences for it to use root powers; but the moment I did this and granted root access to it  it wouldn't open  so I had to reset it  losing all my settings!

Service Nice,3
Stops logging It was working perfectly for years  but now it stops logging when I receive a call on S3.,3
No notifications I'm currently using a LG-LS720. Everything works fine except I have notifications on but I never receive an alert. I have to open the app  then refresh the page before an icon shows up. Just frustrating. I've missed a lot of messages and notifications.,3
Sagar Hasan,3
No comparison  it's the best app. Please add recycle bin option. If possible then add usb support as well. Atleast add recycle bin option  this is must  even in the simplest app. It's superb. Keep it up.,3
SPLENDID A roaring improvement,3
Good  but I have recently discovered that the 'Best Steak' is misleading  since the App adds days shown in a transparent way in the 'History' section (why?) which alters the 'Best Streak' section. So  instead of i.e. 2 days that have actually been accomplished it shows  say  12. I didn't have this before  it only appeared recently. What I mean can be seen in your 4th. screenshot above. Quite annoying. If this wont be fixed I will be uninstalling. Other than that  very good app.,3
good,3
no vi well we apparently does not have vi  i was not able to make a file......and also doesnot respond to sudo root permissions,3

I'm a donor for Wikipedia  so it's clear that I admire and value the work put into this invaluable tool always! However  while having the ability to sign in would seem wonderful and attract many to do so  if thinking that their saved articles would be synced on the server  but this is sadly not the case... Please add synchronization to this app  and make my life  along with the life of others  that much simpler!,3
I love this application. But it required lot of space. Pls try to reduce the installation space.,3

Used to love it ... Loved it for my daily fix of NPR  but no longer works on either of my devices: Nexus 7  android 5.0; Nexus 4  android 4.4. Hoping a fix is on its way soon!,3
I love it Its good,3
Bugs I erased and image and it literally cleared all i have written and there is no undo button. Sometime when i click on bold and italics and write something when i unclick both of them the italics leave the written word and leaves just only the bold p.s you need to add a copy link of post button and an undo button. I also realise it cant upload most images that are a bit large then it says error..sometimes the bold button keeps activating itself after deactivating,3
Good I like using Dvorak and this is the best free app I've seen. That being said  the period placement is terrible. Many.times. a.day I have.to correct.sentences. like this. It's time consuming. Otherwise  pretty great to have a good old dvorak layout,3
This is very important app,3
Lacks finesse - ok for casual users. It needs real multiple server support (that's basic). In playlist I would like option of actual file name instead of track name. It also needs a volume control for hardware that can make use of it. Gmpc has all of these. Look at it for ideas.,3
Can you make it faster,3

If you would stop stealing everyone's identity and tell the people that selling my identity is how you make your money.

I tried using this app with a VoipBuster account. I found it a lot better than VoipBuster's own app! This app runs as a service meaning that incoming calls can be received at any time. There are some aspects that can be improved though! Better apps exist if one is willing to pay a little more!,3
Good game for kids,3
just 3 star so bad if this app read to offline so will be good.,3
Search icon changes position Search icon changes its position every damn time this app starts. Take a look at your picture number 4 and 3. At startup  search icon is near the upper right corner. Then after a second it is near the center top. When I open this app  most of the time I will have to search the article first I want read. But I hit the search icon  I usually end up clicking the star icon because suddenly it is now occupying the previous search icon position.,3
Can't block notifications! As others have pointed out  you cannot block notifications from this app. There are not many  which is good; however  I would prefer none at all. I'll probably remove this app for now until I can get a version that has this feature.,3
No backup feature Would be perfect if there was a backup/restore feature,3
Waste of storage It always takes too much storage but I guess usefull but yet again can't delete it because it helps,3

Hooray for open source! This gets 3 stars for being a free  open source OTP authenticator app (similar to Google Authenticator or Authy)  but loses a star for not saving icon images that I select. It loses another star for not having a mechanism to move codes to a new device.,3

Good graphicgraphicgood graphies,3
Just because google I hate this app...120 MB!!!!!!,3
Yes  it controls your bill someway but Configuration is not user friendly at all and interface can lead to some confusion to configure and get precisely information. App has some obscure bugs and doesn't allow to account short billing periods (e.g weekly and daily). Also it is not possible to disable data billing  although it works well. Updates are not frequent and app is somewhat outdated,3
Hey How about 4.4.2,3

Updates take up way too much space. If I update all my apps I couldn't take any pictures. Apps like Google hangouts and docs don't open cause I haven't updated them  and I need them for school work and projects  but they're unusable. Let me enjoy my out of date app in peace instead of blocking me from using it,3

crashes since 7.0.5 crashes every Minuten since Version 7.0.5 in nexus 9,3
Works just fine. Few complaints. Works as advertised. Very few bugs. Seems stable and useful. I hate how if I have an app open  ACDisplay will close it  and I'll have to manually go back into it every time I open my phone up. The feature that allows me to go directly into a notification doesn't work  but that's not a big deal. The design and amount of options are what make this app worth having.,3

Nice work  but too big of a RAM expense On my tablet this extension takes over 50 MB of RAM  when the host takes a reasonable 15 MB (better dash clock). Sorry  I just can't afford the hit. Shrink the package somehow and I'm all in.,3

No support for the 23MP sensor in my camera  sticking with stock app  however I am hopeful of an update for my Xperia z5c,3
It came as a bit of a surprise that the app is not able to create folders inside the vaults. A flat directory structure is not really very useful. The app itself is nicely done and offers reasonable functionality. Also the files really are encrypted on the physical storage  unlike many other apps that simply fake it.,3
Could be faster,3
Declining performance I've used this app for the last 6 years but over time the performance has declined. For the last several months I've had emails disappear  deleted emails reappear and now emails are not being pulled in from the server unless I refresh. Checked my settings and found no problems. It was good while it lasted. Uninstalling.,3

Please bring back the clean up list feature ASAP. The shake to clean up that others have mentioned does not appear to work on my Samsung S7. It's a real bummer.

Often freezes  great app otherwise I'm on a Nexus 9 and this thing freezes my tablet about every third time I use it. None of the buttons work and it requires a reboot  only to come back and nothing has been saved in the puzzle. Hopefully the developer will see this because its a nicely designed app otherwise.,3

Like it so far No fault in the app but Google has blocked me from signing into my Gmail account because this app doesn’t meet the security requirements. Sure that’s just an excuse for them to get me to download the Gmail app.,3

What it's missing: Ability to precisely change kelvin tempurature / Manual focus / Shutter speed / More specific iso / the ability to change almost anything on the shooting screen. Just not as professional of an app as I'm looking for.,3
Access to shows is awesome. But for some reason every 20 or 30 mins it just closes without warning and I have to go back in and restart the episode and then find where I was. Kind of a bummer because I have no way of knowing how long I've been listening to an episode. Please fix. Otherwise i love it,3
Needs help with clues. I like this app except for one thing. I would like to see across and down clues at the same time  and more than just one. So when working a section I don't have to jump around to see clues. Go to LATimes online and look at that setup as an example. Would use this all the time if that could happen.,3

excessive reliance on SRV records I wanted to use this with Oracle Beehive XMPP  but the reliance on a specific SRV record instead of allowing custom server name and port is  frankly  counterproductive. If this is the best XMPP app for Android  it should not close off avenues like basic custom settings. This is unfortunate  and so I got a refund. I guess the next stop is Xabber.,3

some lame changes You can no longer choose 2 skip filled boxes in a clue which makes it very annoying.. re: no longer seeing incorrect boxes highlighted  u have to change it while a puzzle is open. The swipe to delete or archive action sucks..if you added a 3rd option of nothing it would be fine. I just lost 1/2 a completed puzzle cuz the phone thought I wanted to delete it. Change those back and I'll give it at least a 4. PS Signed: Not a Cave Woman lol,3

Not Completely Compatible for 5.0+ I was using this app for over a year in my previous android phones but i noticed when I switched to the 5.0+ version of Android i noticed that the lockscreen features weren't stable anymore it doesn't appear sometimes. And sometimes the notifications don't even show up,3
Wish it was consisteny Will stop shows and switch along the playlist every ten minutes or so. Please fix,3

Not good for creating film Though i selected 24 fps on video recording  it will still record 29 with the main camera and 24 with the front camera. This has made video editing a lot of work and messes with the rhythm of the video. Not recommended for the noobie film maker on a (seriously low) budget. Otherwise  its amazing for any other kind of recording.,3

Good but facing small issues The app is well designed and it is very good. But we are facing a small issue. When talk back is switched on  the phone ringtone is not working.. We had already reported this bug and it was rectified. But we are facing it again. This small issue has to be rectified.,3
Multi account Guys. I was invited to one more play account of client. Since then this app cannot log in. Its quite long like this. Is it that difficult to handle it? Just show the first you see or let me choose in dropdown. No need to see both. It's always been very helpful app.,3

Nice  needs an offline feature Nice app indeed  but I would like to download the playlist for my daily commute. Would be five stars then.,3
Not my cup of tea Skill points are spread too thin for how long it takes to level up. Way too potion reliant for my taste. Otherwise it's a pretty solid little rpg. I did uninstall for those reasons though. I was also tired of the miss to hit ratio. Seemed like they used a different function than the ratio from percentages.,3

good app good for most  but for some apps it shows not useful stuff. Hope this can be looked more into  with each individual app seperately.,3
Doesn't actually clear clipboard Seems decent as a manager  but it doesn't do the one function I wanted - deleting items in this app doesn't actually remove them from the Android clipboard.,3

UI needs work Functionally it works perfectly  but ui and usability is poor. I have 16 accounts with 2fa.....no way to organise the accounts or search. If you want Google authenticator to become synonymous with 2fa and people to adopt it for more of their accounts.....please fix.,3
Simple  and minimal permissions  but looks for every playable file on the device and then lists them track by track  so get a lot of useless stuff I don't want to see. I want to be able to specify which folder/s to look in  and then have music presented by artist - album. Doesn't play WMA files.,3

What happened to the Gulf of Mexico helicopter chart? In an older version they were in and available but not in the updated version. It was a great app for me until that disappeared.,3
It's great!...but I actually love this app. It does what it's says it does without and fluff or needless frills. I bought a new car and started tracking my fuel from the first tank. I have always done this with paper but decided to go electronic this time. Unfortunately  my phone started acting up and I had to do a factory reset. We'll  I lost all my data. That sucks. This app needs a way to back up your data to Dropbox or Drive - preferably automatically. I took 2 stars off for that. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.,3

Editor Build.prop editor is not working I'd try to edit but it's not making any changes,3
Very good,3
Open source but why is it so bad I guess I shouldn't be surprised. File managers on android are even worse than Windows. Cut is basically worthless Berwyn sdcard and internal because it fails. But copy and delete works fine. Figure that one out. There's no way to resize the display of icons so I can see more than 32 pixels of an image. It's impossible to find which image I want to move. Come on  seriously? Use a good file manager like Dolphin (KDE) and get back to me with those missing features you need.,3
Why there is no option to set pattern?,3
This was a very promising app  but the code hadn't gotten a commit in over a year now  so i assume it's been abandoned. While it's usable  unless development picks up again I can't recommend it.,3
Nice,3
Good,3
Good Up to date,3
Not working It does not work,3

Faulty and Resolution (LG Android) Reading for 5g signal I see no data. I am using secured internet. The results that is demonstrated on my LG Android does not match examples. I saw two settings 5g and 2.4  what I saw from examples on this page definitely is not found in the app. Software and this app is updated. I selected 5g setting. That https email is invalid I am disappointed. UPDATE I saw a tiny bit of improvement.,3

Put a space or - between digits to have groups of 3 and bring back dark theme.,3
Chhatram,3
Looks clean  but too bright I like the new look. Change is refreshing. Always appreciated that the developer doesn't ignore this app. Hoping for a dark theme. Downgrading my rating because the word direction randomly changes which is incredibly annoying.,3
Center problem I've tried emailing the dev  but got no response. When using Goole Now Launcher  the wallpapers are not centered  as GPL starts from the first rather than the middle page. Please provide a fix for that!,3

Okay  but needs more 3 stars compared to the other similar utility that I'm using (which I gave 4). If you get to synching across devices (which it can do and is infinitely useful.) before they get to sharing clips (which you can do) that'll go to 5 stars. ?,3
Airplane mode Loved this app until I was on a flight. I put my phone in airplane mode and this app kept turning Wi-Fi on.,3
Very temperamental If you minimize the app before the files transfer to your phone  you lose it all. If it's seeding  you have to baby it until it's finished or you lose it all. Other than the obvious frustration from that  it's actually pretty good. I've found some really good stuff on there. I gave it 3 stars for that reason. If you fixed the problems with it  it would definitely be a 5 star app.,3
Please fix it... Earlier it's was working well.... After last update I am not able to delete files through this app,3
What is this 🤔,3
I don't understand why but sometimes for what seems to be no reason the screen just completely goes black and I can't see anything. I started up Persona 3 Portable and partway through the opening cinematic  the video just stopped completely. Is this a big  and if so  a common one? Maybe a fix?,3
Great but a lot of connection issues Great app but looses connection and sometimes i can't even connect to my deluge server  same on all my phones and tablets. But webui with browser on deluge works without any issue. Same issue on all these devices Nexus 5/5x/7/10,3

Clean design  but no jump forward/backward I like the overall design of this app  but as far as I can tell  there's no way to jump forward/backward 30 seconds. This is a must-have for skipping intros  as fast-forward is imprecise and slow to respond. Yatse is better for my use case.,3
Please fix KitKat bugs I'm on stock 4.4.2  APK files Dont show the embedded icons. Please fix.,3

Cant take screenshot? Im not sure of this app removes the ability to screenshot due to its ultimate maximum security. But during a non-encrypted convo I should be allowed to screenshot. Or you should just enable screenshotting. I had to use someone else's phone. Take photos and upload them. Could you please add an option to turn screenshot on? Thanks.,3

"Reply to dev  2/23/2017: I'm not guessing it was draining my battery; my battery tools and observation told me so. No rocket science involved. And yes  it was unfiltered. I can only imagine what it'd be like turning on filters! [Original review: It *may* have some valid use  but it'll likely eat through your battery – VERY QUICKLY! On my last device  which was rooted  I used this dev's very good XModule  Privacy. Because I was rooted  that and *every* other XM drained my battery so fast! This app is doing that too and was gone within 15"""" of installing. (BTW  rooting has its plus side  but DON'T EVER LET THEM FOOL you into thinking longer battery life is one of them!)]",3
If there was a checkpoint or save point  it may be easier to play the game 😂. Overall  I liked the gameplay and the graphics. Maybe it'll be good too if you make a game that the graphic like this but have the gameplay like final fantasy series (random battle  have a story  worldmap  etc.)  I would be more love to playing more and more and more the games. 😍,3
Yes,3
Better After my scathing criticism of previous versions this update is better. I still don't like the gaudy interface but at least it now shows I am actually connected to the Tor network. And it seems to check for connectivity even though the interface does not indicate anything when I disconnect. But much better  so thanks lads! But I still have issues as many web pages showing unavailable including the Tor check site. Will only use if my trusty vpn is down.,3

Love that you can choose which puzzles will download automatically  but after 4 to 5 hours of accumulated playing it stops showing mistakes no matter what settings you select. Always have to uninstall & reinstall to fix  but does it again & again. A pain. Otherwise would have been perfect.,3
Was great  less so now Loved this app when it first came out  but lately it uploads all my posts in 16pt font. No option to leave it as default or keep original formatting. This requires editing the post manually through the website. Quite annoying.,3

"Accessibility issues - fonts Devs: Only a set range of font sizes are available  which is a blemish on an otherwise awesome app. Font sizes all top out  sometimes at relatively low values. Example: composition view hits maximum at a font called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""larger"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" which is about 2.5 mm on my device. Unlimited font scaling is available in some apps - would be good in K9 also. Fonts could be configurable at a percent value (ex: 250%)  with no top-out or limit. Please look into it! Eye strain is becoming an epidemic.""""",3

I love how it can be used for language learning  but it does have some faults. The main thing that I find to be inconvenient is the lack of ability to add downloaded audio. It only allows you to record yourself  which is not helpful for language learners. Please fix this,3
Searchs URL search's are not working. Specifically from SoundCloud. But I guess the new update stopped that so over all I can find a few songs on this app.,3
Well I do see the hidden codes  however I think that a description of what the code does is warranted  considering that some can really screw up devices.,3
Fair The adds are annoying and it sometimes shows it hasn't completed a download. Sometimes it fails to download entirely. Also it doesnt have a great deal of Albums. But it does have quality songs if u can get through the drawbacks,3
Ehh It's not that good it's okay,3

This app has so much potential but updates are few and far between not to mention that it is plagued with sync issues. I would actually love to see ads in this app in order to support the creators so that more work can be put into it  that or it becoming the official BGG app and getting support from the site.,3

Good app but it force restart my phone in the middle of configuring icons all the time. Also think there should be a user defined app position for pinned apps.

Awesome idea  looks nice. Only one thing  why not able to overlap transparent nav bar? Almost makes me not want to use the app since I can only have the top corners rounded. Hopefully this gets fixed soon  3 stars until then.,3
inverse/night mode pls! was good before arrows version  thx for removing them. pls move all buttons to menu or optional? reduce app siz pls or split?,3
Not there yet. It's really clunky when it comes to checking variations/candidate moves. It would be so much better if review and analysis modes where merged; and the engine on/off put on a toggle on the top line. It has a long way to go to get close to the PC version; ok for a free app  but the dev has done better work before.,3
For basic model no need this services but with out this it wont work,3
What happened? Used to be really good but now will not store maps onto sd card even though there is still 15gb left,3

It's ok,3
Great puzzles but app needs work. The puzzles are good ones  but I have three issues that keep it from being 5-star. *Fix the sensitivity problem on the puzzle squares. *Make a back button for use after accidentally switching to clues list. *Save stats with finished puzzles. By the way  I LOVE this app. That's why I want to see it improved. It could be my favorite app of all time.,3
No hex I rated it 5 stars  and would've love to do it again but I don't know why hex codes don't show up on my mobile. It's just RGB or RAL.,3
It is functionally sound. However  I would like to disable the auto copying of the generated code to the clipboard. I would also like a setting to use a different barcode scanner on android which can recognise the QR codes easier & faster.,3

Edited: Map can't find my position Has access to location  location icon lights up in notification bar  but nothing happens in the app. Other map apps have no problems detecting position. Using OnePlus 2  with stock OOS 3  and now with CM14. This has been the case for months for me  I've changed multiple firmwares and OSMAnd location never worked. Edit: right after wiring this it worked for the first time. All i did was okay with directions.,3
Edit: Still broken in version 1.40.22. This app has so much promise  but fails in the most basic feature- adding stock symbols. I'm on the latest version & still can't add some symbols such as ^RUT for the Russell 2000 index on either the new or old API.,3

So I go back in setting and its on again. I've paid for it yesterday and I had to Chang it 3 or 4 times. I have to unchek the publicity everyday even after donating $3.

Nightmare! Hackers are Welcome!! This software opens the door to many  and I mean MANY hackers who enjoy making people's enjoyment utterly impossible. You have to stay out of Google in an effort to save your data  if you report the situation nothing is done. But you have to have Google to have a smartphone instead of a $600.00 I -phone. Go figure  and while you figure u your money thrown out the door that your hackers use. If Googled care  a multi trillion $ Corp.

Great to categorize books but doesn't seem to scan children's books This is a great app to categorize all my kids books  we literally have about a thousand classic books and I wanted to keep track of which ones we have. But the scanning doesn't work. I scanned about 30 different books and not a single one was found. Just says invalid. So I have to manually put in each isbn. Would give 5 stars if the scanning worked.,3
Should make it more practical,3
Go ahead,3
Ok Problems i have: There's no option to make the appearance and extensions on the home screen widget different to the ones on the lock screen. There's no option not to display the date.

Used this app for the first time today. I reached my destination but only after having to double back on myself a few times due to the voice navigation being slow at telling when I needed to turn - this was even after changing the settings to be notified 150m before a turn  hopefully this will be sorted in later versions. I will definitely try it again though and hopefully be able to add another star or 2 :),3

Updated  zoom and fit to screen still broken OK  I really like this app. I'd pay for it  if the zoom issues ever got fixed (this update actually made them worse  now the zoom is even glitched viewing individual clues and words). I still enjoy the app  I'm just a bit frustrated by the inability to even manually zoom out while fit to screen is broken. Ah well. Hopefully later updates will help.,3

"Nice except for a couple things. But it's also free so.. Needs option to color the actual time and date not just the header and event.

That's NOT the date. I'd much rather have display options like Tue  Sept 5  than Tuesday  September 5 which doesn't fit my header. Also no response to feedback ever and no way to leave it on git hub.

Brilliant as 2FA but what they do not tell you is that the backups are as good as a chocolate teapot! Whatever you do  do not lose  factory reset or format your phone. If you do  anything of worth is lost forever and the backups DO NOT work! In other words  it is good as a toy but if you use it for anything serious then you are highly likely to lose that something forever!,3
Don't know about this It's OK but my phone acting up since I downloaded it,3

Very important app,3
It's very super,3
It's a great emulator but pls add a fast forward button,3
Love the app  but the ability to set it as a lock screen is meant to be secure  no matter if the pin or password options are easy to bypass  a lock screen is a lock screen. If there is no security it's just a screen.,3
Alarm now sounds as notification. The permissions were already given. Probably a reinstallation was needed. Gonna use older one for now.,3

Can't always find the music I want but it is free For free songs it's great  i only wish there were more songs. Lately I've had a hard time finding alot of the songs I'm searching for  it will display other songs from the artist but not the one I'm searching for. It would also be nice if you could search by the name of the song & not just the artist name bc i don't always know the name of the singer but i can usually guess what the name of the song is. In the end I have to remind myself it is free so can't complain to much,3

Not as integrative as I would hope Three things plague this app for me. 1-You cannot upload on the featured image button  you have to do that on the main screen of the site. 2-You cannot get the edit post link through the app  have to log into dashboard on a browser. I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello. 3-There is no word count visible. I need that since the sites I write for have a minimum word count. All three of these would make this a five star app for me  else it is useless for me and I might as well just write through the browser.,3

I'll find a song and click to download but it just won't download  it's disappointing. You can't always find the right songs and when you do it doesn't even work.,3
Only one thing to fix The app itself it's good  the problem that I see is basically the user interface  apart from not being very eye catching  I think it's very complicated  maybe some options from the camera interface should be on the settings instead,3
But still I can't download media.,3
Battery Usage Battery Usage has increased for this app. It's was useful. Plz fix and I will reinstall.,3

My preferred manager but..... Major nit with sftp/smb when given an unreachable IP address.

How about just killing the process.,3

Cannot manually enter IP for device Auto detection of the device is great if all of your network is fed by one WiFi router. If you have a larger or more complicated network setup to allow the WiFi network to access the wired network then you need an option for manual IP entry.

Please restore to normal padding Extra padding for tasks has been recently added.

The Best FREE NDS emulator app. If you change up the settings eg. disabling the sound and increasing the frame skip  it will run really well (except for some 3D games like pokemon). For any other games though  I recommend you download this emulator. Also it will take about 20 seconds to load the game.,3
"Needs tweaking in alot of areas such as armor and weapons. Also needs more places to explore. All basic weapons should have additional 3-5 damage.

Good but needs improvement in daydream mode Great lock screen app but lacking in daydream mode. When the phone is in landscape  it cuts off the time with certain animations. The fade animation just fades in and out in one spot  I don't think that will help very much with burn in on amoled screens. I think it would function better like the stock clock app with its extensions collapsed like it is on the lock screen of phones  if the user selects.,3

Not bad. Could really do with being able to open it as more than one window at a time  for example when I want to search something whilst reading an article.

Margins are too big I want to like this app  it seems to have good file compatability. BUT my screen doesn't need giant margins. I did everything I could to reduce them but I'm still not happy. Be nice to eliminate them almost entirely for use on a phone. Some simple preset modes for phones  medium tablets and large tablets would be nice too.,3

More Functionality Please Cool app for pulling up info on games quickly and (apparently) logging plays. I admit I have yet to use the play logging function on the main website let alone on the app. Unless I am being completely daft  it is missing the ability to edit my game collection and post or create forum threads. If these ever get implemented I would absolutely adore this app.,3

Also I'd love to see more colors for the text  more customization generally f.e. What to display for every specific extension and stuff like that  more colors  change fonts  change density of the extensions.. Works on my HS flawlessly otherwise,3

I was primarily interested because this is one of the few which can read AZW3 (mobipocket) format (besides kindle) but realised rendering of same is not very good  ToC was missing and and the files was depicted rather like a .rtf file. Other file format are satisfactory. But biggest problem is that notes and book marks can not be exported or imported making this unsuitable for dedicated eBook reading application.,3

"Suggestions/requests Another New update: """"""""""""""""v0.14.6"""""""""""""""" yet still no improvement on the suggestions/requests for the app  1 • Badge counter issue still not fixed. 2 • Location sharing missing in attachment option. 3 • Favourites contact speed dail bar on top of messages missing. 4 • fingerprint support in passphrase missing. so my lower rating stands as it is  a 3☆ app until you acknowledge and improve the app from user feedback.""""",3

????????????? What to do with this app.,3
Won't let you select a whole folder you have to manually add each photo. So if you have a folder with a hundred folders you have to add them all manually. So this prohibits me from just adding files to a folder and the app be smart enough to add into rotation. Seems very limited.,3

App not working while it's not running App is working fine while it's running but when you close it its not working... When I press vol buttons while it's running in lock screen it turns on torch but when it's not running nothing happens... Why is that so and how to solve it? And yes I've accepted all permissions but when I close the app it seems that it forgot them. I'm on android 6.0 on my Redmi Note 4 MIUI 8. Ty.,3
Needs to have labels when in Spanish English ect,3
Beware  root required. When I purchased this app I was under the impression that I didn't need a rooted phone  based on information from a website that recommended it. My bad for failing to read the app description... Root is definitely required for this app to be at all useful. Unfortunately  this app hasn't been able to help me at all.,3

Beautiful on Ubuntu  but not so much on Android The white background for apps that don't have an icon really messes up the point of the icon pack. All the white washes out an otherwise promising icon pack which looks amazing on Ubuntu but not so much here.,3
Good mpd client  but... Why there is no option to navigate to a directory and have easily available play option/button that will replace current playlist and add to playlist and start playing files in current directory? Surely I am not the only one with audio files organized in directories  possibly without meta data. Bonus would be an option to set the default view (to e.g. files/folders) when the app is opened somewhere in the settings.,3

it's OK it's all good until u want to close the freaking app it take too LONG please fix it ASAP,3
used to love it but it no longer automatically backs up - have over a month of lost texts. this app is also very slow.,3
Almost perfect It downloads puzzles and plays perfectly. The features I use work. I didn't care for some of the defaults but you can change them  luckily. It would be nice to see the puzzle name above the clues  sometimes that helps in solving things. I'd like to change the background color in the puzzle list. Both are nearly white and difficult to read. Also  I've never seen a date sort work. My guess is that it sorts on the day you downloaded the puzzle and not the puzzle's release date. Hmm  possible update items? Update: I touched a puzzle to open it and I saw the puzzle move to the right and off the screen. I was almost done with that puzzle  but could no longer it find it anywhere. So I began swiping the other puzzles and they too disappeared. I found a few in archive and swiped them again and poof  gone. What happened to them? I don't know  but now I'm mad and removed this program.,3
The only issue I have is a huge turn-off for me: the background noise. I have sensory issues  and that background noise grates at me. It wouldn't be an issue if it didn't turn itself back up every time the frequency changes. It's incredibly jarring  and I can't use this program anymore until the issue is fixed. Otherwise  it seems like a good program. I'd really like to use it further  so I hope you can fix this issue.,3
New UI not an improvement! Why has the account name now taken second place to the code? This makes it more difficult to find the right account in the list. And the timeout disc might as well not be there it's so small. Definitely a backward step.,3
Code problem. While reading ... Code snippets in a book looks so tiny... After all ... Very good app.,3
I'm not happy with your new updates. I could Reblog my posts earlier from the app. NOW I CAN'T.😢😢 it doesn't show that option. Not even in the view window...CHANGE IT!!,3
Can't we have hierarchical view... Unlike other productivity app which shows many nodes for a single project,3

Needs a few more customisation options The unlock background should have a transparency option too  instead of having an opaque screen every time you unlock. You should also be able to position the time and notifications  maybe you want the notifications on the right side of your screen or above your time  etc.,3
That is ok,3

Good for reading stories I can barely hear the audio  even though my volume is up to maximum. Also  no exit button.,3
I never used it  but... I never finished setting it up. I dont want it to email the backups to my gmail address. Simply store them on an SD card.would be great. That would be a really cool feature because I shouldnt need to uploaded and then download it back to keep a local copy.,3

Sync issues and missing info When the app works  it works well; however  the app seems to have many issues that make using the website often a better choice. I lost access to my wish list on the app  you cannot view multiple photos of a game  the UI for rating and reviewing games is almost hidden  and the search feature is useless unless you know exactly what you want to find. I use the app to log plays  but for now that's about it.,3
It's ok,3

This app is so polarizing. On the one hand  it is the thing that makes Android so good. On the other hand  it hides rogue apps  pings location freaking constantly  and has always been the second biggest battery drain on my phone.

It's a good lockscreen I really like it  but the only problem is that I can't uninstall? It gives me the option to disable  but there's no uninstall. I went to the application settings instead of the Play Store and the uninstall option is grayed out.

Back button doesnt work This is a fab app. I've reported the same highways issue multiple times directly to the local council but it still isn't fixed. Fingers crossed for reporting it through the app which was easy to use. BUT the back button on my phone doesnt do anything so there is no way to go back a page or close the app without minimising. And there is no option to view the map/issues without starting to log a new one.,3

Good quality audio  but streaming stations can present challenges Though every time you get a phone call or interrupt the apps playback  the feed (at least for broadcast streaming) is cut off. You must restart the stream over. It would be better if  like Pandora or other audio apps  when you left the audio for minute it would simply pause. Then you could come back and hit play and it would stream right away from where you left off.,3

Include in stock It's a hassle to install play services everytime someone updated their roms or install an OTA. It would be preferable if it's included in stock.,3

Decent. It definitely won't improve the visual quality of your photos/videos but the app itself has a good few features more than the stock Android camera on most phones. Bottom line  if you enjoy tinkering with settings  you'll enjoy this app.,3

Used to be the best mail app I used but the latest update has changed how notifications work. Instead of going straight to an account's inbox it just goes to a list of folders instead which means an extra tap... An option would have been great for any UI changes. Reading mail was a lot quicker before this. It's also getting quite buggy... Emptying trash doesn't free up space any more. Either numbers not updating or it's really not being freed. Sometimes an old email gets marked as unread or suddenly my emails are duplicated... Some aesthetic update wouldn't hurt like some icons.,3

This app is a great concept and I am happy to have it but it has its flaws. The predictive text as always anticipating what I might say because I used the same type of conversations but many times it will miss type words or put in what it thinks I said. When I end a sentence it will write out the word question mark or the word period or whatever else I need to use. Unfortunately I am always stopping and have to erase what the app puts in and sometimes it won't even type anything in. Speak very clearly into this app but it has its own mind sometimes,3

Great Browser Limited By One Feature. If you just added the intent feature within your browser this would get a 5 star  but as of right now I can't use this as my main one because of that.

Good app but I have a few security concerns Great app. I wish it wouldn't copy text from my password manager app KeePassDroid(or could a blocked list be enabled somehow so it wouldn't show every time I copy my password?). Maybe an option for the copied text to have an option to (never remember this text again  similar to how you can star copied text you could maybe block text from showing in list). I noticed also if notifications are on it shows the text even when I have the lock screen on. This is not good if the last thing I copied was a password.,3

Getting better Mostly issue free except for one huge one. Every time you log a play the site carries the right data but the app drops to 1 play. The only way to rectify it is to clear the data and resync your entire collection every time you log anything. Anoying. Nice layout and basically a good little filing system if you have a lot of games. Wil be great when it logs plays properly again.,3

Crashes way too much I really want to give this app a higher rating  but the regular crashes are getting out of hand. It seems to crash after heavy-ish browser use  if the browser was left open for a while  or after certain pages are opened up. It's still my daily driver because the speed and adblock are great  but I don't know if it'll be like that for much longer if the crashing persists. It's not uncommon for it to crash at least twice a day. LG G3 Lollipop,3

UPDATE: It's been my favorite mail client for years  it usually just works once you've set up everything. Perfect for IMAP. Though  with Android 6 you have to manually exclude K-9 from battery optimization  else it will stop receiving new mails. However: Ever since a recent major update  they changed parts of the GUI. In message view  attachments are now displayed at the very bottom. You have to scroll aaaaaaall the way down to even notice attachments. So easy to overlook  and to accidentally delete a billing mail because the first few lines looked like every other spam email. What were they thinking?? Give us an option to switch this back!,3

Sonic Adventure How to play the games?,3
Needs Improvement. Tired of the AUTO-CORRECT changing what is typed AFTER its been typed AND CORRECTED it's like arguing with a 2 year old child!!,3
Photos shot directly from Telegram are bad quality  both cameras affected.,3
"Wave to wake works too late. Needs atleast 4 seconds over the proximity sensor  well that certainly can't be called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""wave to wake"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".. I'm sitting like stupid covering the sensor for 4 whole seconds 😕""""",3
Star Picture,3
Is lacking customization option.... I wana set my own frequency or make a whole program that I make for what I want or need! So I'm moving to a similar app that comes with this capability~,3
This works  when it focuses properly This is a good and simple app  but it spends a lot of time focusing in and out  which causes problems with scanning. Would like a manual focus feature.,3
I want my ready 2 rumble My ready 2 rumble round 2 I want it to fix the screen and I love that game and that my first game I ever play and please can you fix the ready 2 rumble round 2 that my favorite game in the world and my favorite character is Afro Thunder I feel it in my bones so can you fix it please I love this game I trust you thank you by Evan Bullie,3
Balabhadra I am a good boy,3
Works half the time. This app is ok but does not work a lot of the time.,3
Functional  but ugly. Design is pretty crappy and unintuitive.,3
If there was a way to edit your own posts and it handled Reddit mark up to show tables then 5 stars for sure.,3
It stopped working for some reason It was working fantastically for about a year now  but now the screen flips as soon as I load up a game and then it quits.,3
Goo Good to use,3
Lockscreen Beta feature & the last update was a Year ago..........sheeeeesh!,3

Colored description coding is required,3
hard to evaluate this works reliably enough for what it CAN do  but functionality wise it's incapable of doing what I actually need it for. After getting a search result from a bot  it's not possible to select within the text received in order to copy and paste it in channel  which renders it pretty much useless to me :(,3
Good,3
Its so coll Thanks for sharing this with you,3

No way to edit files,3
Ok It's not a continuous stream and gets stuck when connecting,3
Big bug with using the app is you can't search in collapsed sections on a page,3
I used to enjoy using d app but recently  its not updating. Pls make it easier.,3
"You could add voice search and also  the option """"open in an external browser"""" would be worth it if it opened the chosen result  not all the results found. The widget opens the app like a shortcut  it doesn't work as a search box  unfortunately.",3
Notification tells me apps wont run unless i update google play services . But google play services wont update after downloading ! This has been going on for over a week or so . Are you kiding me ! Who is in charge of these updates ? Updated after i commented . Waiting to see if it works fine .,3
This app is ok but is full of notifications especially for those that require it for funtioning,3
Not bad... It helps with most of the things so that's pretty fine with me.,3

Since the last 2 updates... im unable to download blue ray movies as it tells me i need to download some program to watch it,3
Great My perfectly piano is the best piano not the piano is MIDI melody  is my new Samsung was free. Acer didn't free  is paid.,3
2 years since update 2012 was the last time this was updated. Pretty sure the developer has abandoned the app. It's a shame considering how useful it can really be.,3
Slow motion?! I've used this app for a long time and only recently have had problems. All songs sound like they're in slow motion. What can be done to fix?,3
This is very important app. We are officially work than this app,3
Imaging way better than file store,3
It works but is choppy and crashes. I don't get it. I'm using an S7 and this thing is crashing. How? Just how?,3
From where i can download full file please share link,3
Need Keyboard Should have an option for typing using the keyboard,3
R Not bad,3
It was the best Ambient display app Lack of development. Other apps  like Glance Plus  are on continuous development and became better always on app option.,3
Its useful but for me it's so difficult to use,3
Very good  but crashes on search for keys as of Dec07 As of December 07 2016  the app crashes whenever I search for a key on a key server and there is an actual result. If there is no results returned  app does not crash.,3
I love it,3
My google app so slow,3
Wish it had a better UI,3
It's ok I liked it but it covers almost whole memory,3
Works but... Choppy,3
Good but weather is not working,3
Fantastic,3
Good for most part Recent update keeps shutting bitcore off so I can't download,3
Its okay....But it's not as great as expected....It's basically the same I guess and there's not many updates....It also still lags on downloads and loading new tabs... Please fix this.thanks.,3
No comments,3

Good Nice app,3
Useless,3
nice hey lets check what im doing for this apps,3
Auto logoff option Needs to have a setting to auto logoff if not used over a period of time. If this was an option I would give this 5 stars.,3
Not activity For avenge the UK activities not start,3
Security Needs some kind of security like a pin or password. Good enough.,3
My phone was factory reset. After reinstalling the app I was expecting my accounts to be in sync after google login  but its not like that. I am still facing issues while logging into aws console.,3
Sound quality is bad,3
The weather Icon does not work.... If it gets fixed  I'll rate 5 stars,3
I had install the update then update it took along time,3
Lost all my data When I started up PPSSPP  I lost all of my games. Fix this and I'll rate 5 stars.,3
I don't know how to download game,3
Not bad at all,3
Where is the network support. I can't access shared folders on a LAN or ssh/ftp to anything...,3
Still 3 stars because this app has some information...Would like if improved,3
keeps disconnected every now n then. doesn't work well with orwall too. am running cm14 nougat 7.1 rom on htc one m8,3

"Good and easy to use. But can you please correct the thing which sucks sometimes. I've a very good Internet connection and in using instagram  Facebook and other apps and only telegram shows """"connecting"""" or else """"bad network"""". Hope you will help thank you!!!",3
Nice,3
Good Start The icons look great but there are some popular apps that don't yet have icons. I really hope more updates are coming.,3
Noooo! The white default icon is way better than pink. Please change back.,3
Vikas sahu Superb,3
Some kind of bug Love what this app offers  but after changing the destination to external SD in accordance with the directions  picture that appeared to have been saved apparently were not  and disappeared! Never had problems saving to internal storage. Android 6.0.1,3
Problem on Image Upload Still need an update. Previous update didnt fix the issue about image uploading.,3

Prove yourself as Indian brand I started using and recommending telegram because its Indian. But for occasions that are in India only  I can't find any stickers. I can find only foreigners stickers other than gandhi ji. Just try to understand users,3
Fine,3
Great design  needs some work. The design of the app is great  I know you are going to focus on memory optimization  but you need to add and change some things. There needs to be an option to disable downloads of wallpapers over mobile data. You also need to make the blur and dim sliders more responsive. You also need an NSFW checkbox  just in case there are those kind of paintings. Hope you consider the feedback.,3
sandhu ityasogoooooooooooooooooood,3
It works but... It seriously needs support for links preview and messaging no longer works. It is still better than the full FB app nevertheless.,3
Please add voice or video call App is very useful and has cool stickers. But we need voice or video call to give it 5 stars. Please add call📞,3
It works,3
Its OK Not too good my device has 3gb ram than also game audio is always running while stopping its like ggggggaaaaammmmmmeeeee,3

Quality icons  too few of them unfortunately,3
Okay but it cannot locate things properly It's okay bothering the locations but we only have to move our phone here and there following the arrow to find a particular thing. After you find u will probably zoom to see a better vision but as soon as you get close the screen starts shaking and your arms start to ache. I tried to zoom to andromeda galaxy. My right hand that was holding the mobile was still and the left one was zooming yet the screen was shaking. That probably means that the app didn't want to let you see it. I say Do NOT download this,3
Basic things missing Great job so far! Easy improvements in my mind: projects field for expenses  import photo from gallery. Not so easy improvement would be an image crop and manipulation.,3
Like the app I like the app  i enjoy it BUT not being able to post pictures is irritating.,3
Good app. Serves it's purpose of providing mfa. Codes are a nice fast 30 seconds ad apposed to 60 sec... my only gripe is when the code is nearing expiration it does not turn red. It does on all my peers iphones.. but not on my droid.,3
Works  but the interface... On the plus side it works more or less without a STUN server where other clients fail (even with a STUN server). On the negative side the interface is taken straight from Android 1.5  it doesn't give the option to select between lines (haven't found any at least)  doesn't allow more than 2 lines)  ... If only they could fix the interface  integrate it properly into Android  ...,3
5 Good,3
whenever I click on a file to download  it disappears from my downloads/transfers list for awhile  then reappears after a couple of minutes.,3
Won't install on note 4 with 4.4.4 Love the idea... Oh well...,3
good app but no offline use I'd give this 5* if i can download for use offline. using this would eat my data. plus since it's talk radio  does it really need to be super high quality audio?,3
It would be better if widget should follow the color customization in the settings.,3
If you own one of the 15 or so devices it supports... Seriously  there is the Galaxy Note (first one) and not the 5? No Galaxy S6? Disappointed. Good mockups though. Hope to see more frames in the future but until now  it hasn't been useful to me so I'll rate it for what it's worth.,3
Itontno,3
Hi I d like,3
Can't restore MMS Although this app will backup your SMS & MMS messages the fact that it won't restore MMS is a huge negative. Furthermore  the dev has stated that this is a feature that won't be added. What's the point of backing up messages you'll never be able to restore?,3
Goog app,3
Nice,3
Please fix copy/move notifications in API 24. Feature request: add exported file provider like in es explorer. So users can choose path to save/load data through this great app.,3
Bugs? I like the app  but it shuts down for no reason at least twice a day. When it shuts down  it also closes other apps I have over.,3
Flash points for yiu incorrectly Not applucablw to a free bee love it,3
Good but snags After several games it introduces no wins and the touch pad betrays moves to errant moves. Using the Solve feature works well on simple puzzles  but on complex ones becomes confused making box canyon moves from which it cannot remedy. A good game but uninstalled due to the errant moves and no win scenarios -- too much like real life to enjoy the no escape aspect.,3
Left align problem Some epub files do not align left correctly,3
Good,3
Good and Bad. Kudos for work in progress. Good: motivates improvements by competitors' avgps apps  direct-to useful  inflight lookup of nav  wx  and apt info  excellent with FSX and Stratux adsb. Bad: UI clunky  flight planning unusable. Summary: Useful only for direct-to function and looking up info. Assembling such good data is an achievement  but needs a better framework for the interface. Still  it's better than paper charts or no charts  as it's free! APA excells in its connectivity apps  too. Recommend this over the also free FltPlanGo  which has UI/planning issues  too. For serious flying  rely on superb Foreflight  iFlyGps  or Garmin Pilot  for which you pay reasonable subscription fees. These pros - notably the first two - offer rock solid data and usable interfaces without issues.,3
Outstanding,3
Enjoyed the game  but there are whole areas i was unable to get to (such as Nor). Wasn't sure if it was a bug or not  but it soured the game.,3
GNex Is not updated almost 5 days.,3
It's good devs are trying to get a real terminal on droids Thanks  I am going to try it out again  there are some in the interwebs saying with your app I can use traditional cmd line.,3

Useful,3
Always stopped ang hanging..,3
Lacking functionality Can only browse 'the hotness' or search so of no use for game searching. As others gave said need some way of saving games. Mostly needs a much expanded browsing function  by genre  age group  mechanic  rating etc and then to filter and sort as desired. Then it would be very useful. Keep developing!,3

It's good Sometimes I try to find old sings on there and they don't show up but other than that it's pretty good and I like it,3
It is quite a good app but it always has to be updated whilst downloaded apps are available,3
I like it  and it's helpful  but... There needs to be a way to save files as MP3. And a pop-up when you're saving for AFTER you set the filename to set the type. Also  it crashes when I try to use the search function,3

"Reading lists I had done many hours of research and used """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""saved pages"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". During subsequent update problems I lost all links to those pages. (hundreds) It would be nice  if these links could be backed up or stored in my account on your server.""""",3
"What exactly does this mean? And why does it say in the notification panel """"network might be monitored""""? Warn: you specified a public address 0.0.0.0.5400 for DNSPort other people on internet might find your computer and use as open proxy. Please don't allow this... Which I haven't changed any default settings or allow this. What am I missing?",3
It's time waste It's very boring and useless,3
Could have more results and faster downloads,3
Certificate issues. I use a Small Business Server with self sig ed certificate which stops K-9. How about an 'Accept All Certificates' option,3
It doesn't work on all phones,3
It's fun but..... I would like more than one life before game over.,3
"My experience is that the buffering seems to throw off the app and shuts it down. Sometimes a stream will go silent for a few seconds  then come back. A few seconds later  it shuts down  but the app remains open. In other examples  favorite stations just disappear. Have test with a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""clean"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" device -- i.e. no addl apps except factory load -- and not had problems.""""",3
Cannot send many files Cannot send PDF .apk etc through Bluetooth.....,3
Soooooooo light and fast. Still  QuickPic is better because of Search  quick select  quick scroll  folder view modes  changing cover pic  mirroring image  and maybe some other things that I've yet to notice,3
from what ive heard its a good app  but try finding a how to use guide on it  you arnt gonna have luck  write a how to use guide ill up my rating,3
Its a great apps but suprisingly its limit my account suddenly & wrongly.. i did nothing.. i did sent mesaages to my contact list..but still there is no solution tu unlimitions my account..please do something..,3
No menus on Note 5...,3
I keep getting notified about the same comment  several times a day. It's becoming a real pain in the ass. Please fix!,4
Simple Basic features. Good app.,4
It's a good gallery  I wish I could change my lock screen wallpaper.,4
Great  clean  and free Just a request for more icons i.e. Instapaper  Flipboard  etc,4
i like sky map and star finder.,4
Great. Except no dual account sync. Open source equivalent of GTasks and Tasks Free. Both of which are good. But this is better  simpler  and open source. It also handles multiple accounts  although its UI doesn't make that clear. Just sign into the second one in settings. CORRECTION: I seem to have lost this ability and in fact the whole programme no longer syncs to either account properly. Strange. Also  if sync fails  uninstalling and re-installing seems to help.,4
Great,4
Loved it It's very useful. Easy to send any message . Best app for chatting,4
President,4

Very attractive,4
Crashes but ok The app crashes whenever you click on hunting horns otherwise this is an amazing app.,4

Like I like this app...mostly cause I'm a crossword maniac. My two complaints are that (at least on my phone) the screen is super small and won't enlarge easily  also navigating between the words is a pain,4
Not working on Lenovo Tab Not working on Lenovo Ta S8-50L. Home swipe only bring a white virtual button doing nothing on click.,4
This is great security for your Google account,4
Its good Leonora,4
Still no history function.. Only one tab saved after a restart.. You should add a QUIT option to the menu and timing so the app turns into dark nice by itself at night ;),4
After the latest update  even once the app is opened the notification in the notification panel still remains. That needs to be cleared manually. Once a mail is moved to trash it cannot be moved to inbox again. Besides these issues it is a very good app,4
Great game but I don't think the monsters should have the accuracy of a professional sniper hitting wings off a fly they should at least even it out and make it level based and even then you level up so slow I dont think it would matter but like the game but come on man I'm a rpg gamer nd honestly this has the base of a fantastic game but it needs a little more work,4
MD.SABBIR 2016,4

Easy to use  simple to set up I have been using this app for over a month now and only wish my bank would accept 2FA. Hopefully they start catching on.,4
Very cool!,4

Micromax bolt a older version,4
Many very useful features  lackluster design,4
Really good  can still be better I like the zooming that (I think) is new to this latest update. I would still like to have a dark mode that minimizes the white space on the screen from the keyboard and clues areas. But hard to complain too much about a free app that I use almost daily.,4
This is a great app  and a wonderful port of the venerable password safe. As many others have stated  I am not crazy about some of the changes in the recent updates. The color theme needs to either be changed back to black or at least give the option. The keyboard is growing on me  but it is still an extra step over the straight copy from the past. It's *our* security  give *us* the option.,4
Tap zone Customizable tap zone please.......,4
Very useful,4
Ok Little bit slow,4
This app is useful for us.,4
Useful It helps me watch YouTube whenever I want to.,4
Its ok Gud,4
Great but needs improvement. Works great with all the games I tested it with... So far.,4
Perfect app ... just add lock screen security options ....,4
Very useful App,4
Google remainders not available Otherwise great and no need to worry about privacy since permissions quite conservative,4
Great app! It could still be improved if it has another widget similar to the Asus' whats next app. But on its own this is a great app!,4
It helps all programing function,4
NPR Lover. I don't go a day without listening to NPR. I can't imagine driving around without it.,4

War Driving can be fun Almost every time I get into the car. I turn on the Wiggle War Drive program and the phones GPS. I check to see how many new wi-fi and cellphone hot-spots are out there. Be careful it does use the battery power. Make sure you have a car charger in the car with you.,4
Vibration doesn't set up at boot The vibration intensity isn't working  to set the vibration intensity I am using trickster mod. However the other options are working perfectly. Good app with clean interface.,4

Please update the app  man Listen to the users ?,4
secure more save with 2 step auth,4
Good appa,4
Decent Has been working much better. Now Contacts update photos when you click on them  or in many cases update to an HD picture. Only problem is still syncing contacts that have a different name on FB. There needs to be an easier way to do this than having to manually enter some FB ID code in a notes section or something. I've tried to add a link to their profile and this did not work. There are no instructions. There should be some sort of search function that simply links a phone contact with a FB contact  and then then Ubersync should handle the code if necessary. Please implement that. Keep up the good work.,4
When Media file stopped while playing in chat window  it should also close the media player from title bar.,4
Great alternative! Much better than the intrusive resource hungry Facebook apps,4
Excellent  but lacks app support. I'd like to control spotify with this remote  but there's no support for apps (yet?),4

Nice cam  good focus modes,4
I love this game  have loved it for years. The original version is the best. Just I eould give it 5 stars if you continued to update this one into 2017  not like the last update in 2015,4

Play Service It's got an error on Samsung Galaxy S5 too.,4
Nice app Good psp emulator for android,4
Great  but there seems to be a glitch This is the app I didn't know I needed! It's always good to have something different to inspire you every day. But guys  it looks like some of the wallpapers are shown horizontally cut in half... can you please look into that?,4
Very cool! It without be nice if you could hide the frequently used apps but I don't see anything for that in the config file. Autocomplete also won't let you string many words together like typing h  choosing help  then typing c and choosing call will delete help and replace it with call  when I'm expecting it will put call after help so I can execute help call... Otherwise pretty fun!,4
It's great! No complaints. Clean UI  though it could look stand to be a little more stylized,4
Worked My sms and mms backed up to my Gmail! It was a life saver cos my att message cloud some how got deleted an now isn't synchronizing so thank God most of my texts are on my Gmail! The only thing I hate is when I restored them on to my new phone the text are there but my pictures I had attached did not restore so u can see the conversation but no pictures to tell full story an I needed the text an pictures for a legal case!,4
Woke up my S7 Edge screen pretty well. If you can't log in with your fingerprint  head to settings &gt; security &gt; other security &gt; device administrators and disable screen notifications.,4
Very good audio player This is a solid player that let's you access you or a friend's music collection on the go. Many great features. My one suggestion (if I didn't just miss the feature) would be to give more control over the playback buffer. For example when a song is playing it will often pause to buffer. It would be nice to say don't start play back until 1mb or 1 minute of playback is available. There may be protocol limitations that prevent this feature  but if not that's one for my stocking this Christmas :),4
The best reddit app I have used. My only complaint is it doesn't support tables which makes some posts quite messy.,4
Only one flaw Whenever you go to android during a game and come back  the board will be flipped when you are playing black... Is this fixable?,4
Keep screen on Makes using Kodi much easier then trying to setup LIRC. It really needs a keep screen on option that dims the screen but leaves it accessible without having to unlock your phone each time.,4
Great I love this app. It's great and has an option to add image from other source without paid.. Things that I don't like from this app are  this app sometime can be too laggy and lack of female character comic.. Except from that two things  this app is good,4
Good I really like this app thanks to its minimalistic look. Simple  clean and fast. The only problem with the latest update is that now when I copy an item  the bar at the bottom which appears seems to have overlapping text which cannot be read and gets quite annoying.,4

UI and design seizes the cost of 1 star The UI of the game and design of the app options can be more great just check out PPSSPP design and UI. I just love it and app can be graphic and beautiful anyway keep up the good work bro,4
All's good. It would be a good idea if they manage to squeeze the table columns into a mobile screen.,4

It's useful,4
Always works great for music and podcasts. Shuffle doesn't shuffle the entire offline library  rather makes a 30 or so song playlist that eventually loops. That is a little annoying. Also wish chromecasting videos worked.,4
I like,4
Carbons message is good I need xep-280. Because i use laptol and mobile to chat. It's yaxim only good supported,4
Fan Fan fan,4
Good one Very good application,4
Menu button Hi guys can someone help me find the menu button (where you save and frameskip as such) for this app after opening a game? Would really be greatful. I had this app ever since but recently I bought a new phone s6 edge + and couldn't find a menu button. Thank you,4
Good but can we get custom lock screen backgrounds instead of the same as the home screen,4
Great app,4
Google When I ask you a question,4
Works well for me,4
love it,4
Great app Luv the app  could b more stable as it has crashed on me before.,4
WP Its Awesome,4
No!!! What have you done to the theme? It's horrible. This app was clean and intuitive  now it looks messy. And also CPU clock control is not working for me now. Reverted to previous version.,4
Good But we can't load the game,4
Need to backup pictures also Hopefully picture backup will be included in a future update.,4
It need's the fastforward cause i hate playing games to slow,4
Very good Good,4
Only reasonable way to use a smartphone It's already close to perfection  but imho it should offer whatsapp next to a contact.,4
It's nice,4
Fix the crashing issues,4
Amazing app :D,4
Almost Perfect The only problem is your stuck to 4 panels. Plz add more! Then I'll rate 5 stars.,4
Switched to this keyboard. If this keyboard did capitalization on swipe up (not changing the keyboard to capital letters  but actually inserting that letter as a capital)  and secondary characters (punctuation etc.) on swipe down  it would be perfect.,4
Excellent Approved,4
Simple and light.,4
Good apps,4
Great  except for one thing I don't understand what the leftmost button do (it looks like a book with star on the cover),4

Data update stopped 01May : Concept  presentation and ease of use is good but since few days the data update has stopped and app is not useable. Seems not compatible with marshmallow version. ... 03May : issue has been resolved  hence improved my rating from 1 to 3. ... 07Jun: Upgraded my rating to 4 after newer release.,4
Good,4
Its good but now i cant dwnld anything :-(,4
Unable to update my mobile.pls help me.,4
Almost Perfect Works great  plays all my old music. Only issue is that it seems to pause the music if ANY paired bluetooth device disconnects. If I have my phone connected to my laptop  for example  and happen to walk away  the music stops  even if my bluetooth headphones are still connected just fine.,4
Not work which root on lollipop,4
So slow Its so slow and when i unrared it (if thats even a word) the rar file said try to decompress again,4
Nice work! Really helpful to determine the state of my battery  whether it is active or in deep sleep. Tracing the root cause of battery drains can sometimes be a pain without background knowledge  but hey  there is google to help.,4
Please put the calling option. .otherwise app is soo good.,4
Love this game  but.. We need something new. I've played the game so much. I get floor 50 everytime. Blah blah  so much fun...but it's getting boring. Give me a new hero or something. A new weapon type. Something cool. Mainly a new hero I think would shake things up and I would fall in love with the game again,4
It's really good You should add pvp and coop features for online help also maybe a trading interface,4
Good But better luck next time for better interface and services.,4
Would be nice to have an option to set a custom wallpaper.,4
This is very usefull me,4
"I love these things but... You guys need more stories and understand more commands. I tried all kinds of commands but it was just """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""fill it"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Fill what with what? And they tell me to be specific... My Dreamhold isn't working. Whenever I type """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""go east"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" it forces me to close. Also  how do you go back to your game after looking at the hints? I pressed all the buttons and none of them led me back.""""",4

why do I need this I have never needed it before,4
I really LOVE this app  but I had to revert back to the 1.5.9 version . I have no idea why the latest version didn't work for me. I installed it twice  restarted the Galaxy S5 phone  etc.  but no luck.,4

Very good aap amuletor so beutiful aap,4
Every now and again it's a pain  but overall a good app It's a great live wallpaper  my only issue with it is sometimes it gets de-centered and then it's a real pain to get it properly centered again. But other than that  works like a charm.,4
Great app! One of my favourite camera apps! Would be even better if we could take multiple exposure HDR photos on burst mode.,4
OK This app confirmed my cell signal was pants  but I'm not sure it is essential,4
Free  ad free  good quality  lightweight  good job !,4

Please add ability to cache bookmark fav icons. It reloads the bookmark icons every time I open the bookmark drawer.,4
Easy  straight to the point. GOOD APP...only problem is that u can't misspell and small selection,4
Peer list and their infos are missing :(,4
Better of My Mobile,4
Very useful App Hanger has been such a useful app for quick launches. It's even better when used with Lollipop which bring the notifications to the lock screen. It's now replacing all the locking apps I have tried. Just a small glitch I have encountered: some apps are not appearing in the app list of hanger (Google maps in my case). thus no way to pin it,4

Good app,4
Google Play What can I say  I like Google.,4
Fairly Good The light weight makes it a better option in the competition of messengers. Nice work  looking forward to new development.,4
Cool app but It crashes when i import images from other sources,4
The only thing keeping me from switching over from quickpic is photo rotation. Please add auto rotate in your app even if I portrait lock system wide. Other than that  everything they say here is the same. It's nice to finally have an alternative to quickpic.,4
Needs battery percentage Needs a battery percentage bar or glow or something.,4
Okay Awesome,4
Root Its used for me for rooting my device,4
Made in India,4
Nice,4
"Two gripes - font size & scheduled posts I like this app and I really do want to stick with it (it's a toss between this and slim social) but not having the option to change font size as I can in slimsocial may be the deal breaker. It is smoother than slimsocial on my phone but the default font size is simply too small on an average smart phone... Unless I'm missing an option somewhere  in which case I'd appreciate advice!?! Also  scheduled posting in managed community pages doesn't work - """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""post"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button is non-responsive!""""",4
Gpod,4
Love the puzzles. Better UI? This app is great - tons of fun and challenging puzzles in a tiny package. It's replaced a lot of puzzle games I had. The look of the app is kind of dull  though. It proves how much appearance can affect a player's experience.,4
Raz ~\#()%dont know,4
Only lacks a setting for increment value Title says it all. This app lets you put several counters  and has a simple yet elegant design. All that it lacks is a setting for increments for each individual counter. Until they put that  I'll stick to using other counters.,4

It's missing is the ability to remove the Inbox label so that we don't see them in your inbox. Especially if you have a custom label setup.,4
Yes It's good,4
Lightweight app which perfectly replaces the original FB app. No unnecessary permissions or resource hogging. Only thing it lacks is notifications but I can live with that. At least you don't need to install FB Messenger to read your PM's!! 5 stars if notifications are added.,4
Love it. But I have a problem I am running most of my games with ease and I really love this emulator. However I just started playing a game called sword of the berserk guts rage it has really bad graphics glitches in the game could anyone help me? Maybe it's a compatibility issue,4
Efficient and quick,4
I think this app is great but you should more commands like.... Incognito mode chrome  volume change  direct WhatsApp message  notification  setting sub menus etc,4
Love the app  but... It was great when I had a Nexus⁴  but now I have a Sony Z Ultra... Is the reason for not adding a particular device not having the device rendered? Perhaps the community can donate renders of their requested devices???,4
Very good app Seems to be fairly accurate works well when you don't have an actual level handy..,4
Battery drainer. Nothing that i can do,4
About old version I loved the new version rather than the old version which was disturbing interms of updating my phone's software.,4

Good start  more flexible than the stock app. Needs to be able to write the SD card (6.0.1  S7  200Gb SD),4
Love it! Since I've been using open office to write a big story (personal project)  this app has allowed me to read my saved chapters on the go. I had no trouble opening my files and the simple and clean ui allowed for a smooth read. My only issue is that the edit document option doesnt work. A little irritating when I come across spelling mistakes I wish to fix on the spot. And to those complaining about the app not opening .doc files  maybe try reading the app info. It opens open office specific files.,4
Nice love,4
I love this I change my wallpaper everyday so having this do it automatically for me is so good. Like the blur though don't use it. Super sad it's not working for me now that I'm on Android Lollipop Dev preview. Don't know whether the problem is in Lollipop support or ART support,4
It’s good I just really want to use it with Apple Music on android! Any plans to make it available? :(,4

Dipak Barman,4
Yes Best smart start,4

Great job so far! It has a bunch of info that I can use for any hunt I wanna go on! Unfortunately the armor set builder doesnt work... fix that and I'll have all 5 stars for you. Maybe more detailed info on monster stats  like attack damage and health would be another welcome addition!,4
It's easy to use full,4
Great app! But It would be great if it would work with my lock screen also....,4
I think it's good app,4
Addictive! I have this on my tablet and am adding it to my phone. A nice range of challenging puzzles to engage your brain and no ridiculous  flashing nonsense or insufferable adverts. If this had initially been on a free trial basis I'd pay to keep it.,4

I've been looking for an app such as this for a long time. Great app to. For five stars I would like to see 1) possibility to center other spots in images and 2) possibility to select a folder  3) easier scrolling of folders (can't fast scroll through thousands of images on a SGS7). Edit: well  then you get 4 33 stars ;-),4
I would pay with some improvements I like its simplicity. It's a glorified checkbook register. I'd like to see a way to delete entries  reset the envelopes  and widget updating. Simple is better!,4
Great app  but we really need manual reordering!,4
S i Love Very nice,4
Gyro is all outta whack its has everything upside down... Plz. fix,4

Works well  still needs updates. I love this app for it's purpose. It's been well over a year  the wrapper is still a web browser and needs updates for security I would expect. Otherwise  it might be better just to use another browser.,4
Study and Learning I love this app! I have used the study and learning that works great as well as the pain killer. This is my third time to download this app because it's awesome.,4

It's better,4
Good - Settings need options Nice free reader. I like being able to search books using a word term. Suggestions: More menu options like  Do NOT open the last book read when using the app next time because it takes years to load it and I want to read something else. Or easier way to always get to settings or your library of books in one click.,4
MMX A59 Hmm its gudd,4
Open document Works well.,4
I like this apps so much..,4
Its ok I want to use this but it gives me problems with updating the binary. Should just work from the go like other SuperUser apps.,4

"I literally could not find another app that does what this does. There is even a connector for my obscure provider  albeit in a dormant state so I had to build from source but it still worked. It's not the prettiest app but you shouldn't have to look at it much if you couple it with SMSdroid. The interface is a little confusing in places. I turned on test rules mode but then sent a couple of real messages by accident as I didn't realise that I needed to explicitly select """"""""""""""""Rules"""""""""""""""" as the current provider. The rules system itself is great though  exactly what I need.""""",4

I got this to automatically raise the volume for my car's Bluetooth without having to endure the volume warning from the system. Occasionally it only raises it to the pre-warning volume  meaning I still need to turn it all the way up manually.,4
Ya good app you can,4
Overall great but a bit buggy. I enjoy this app but it still randomly crashes when I look at pictures in an article. Also  sometimes it takes forever to update new articles. Feels like these bugs should be hashed out by now.,4

Good for surveying - particularly recorded notes and tracing routes. Sometimes hard to stop it tracking  but it does the job well. I use it for surveys on foot  bicycle  and bus. It's easy to use  and easy to upload the data to OSM and to export the data for other applications. I get an API Key Required message when I use OpenCycleMap as the background tiles.,4

Pretty cool app but.... I was looking for more of an app that when it hears a note It shows with da note is. Any suggestions??,4
UI Best KeePass client. I only wish that devs took a look at UI. It would deserve Material redesign.,4

Bun dar Ar fii ok sa pot sa slide left side right intre tram bus troleu  și să se vadă clar care e selectat. Nu înțeleg de ce troleul e in alta categorie și nu la autobuz.

Very good. But lately Wi-Fi seems to be turning on occasionally while in airplane mode. This did not happen before. Is this something in the application  or perhaps a change in Android? Once this is fixed: Five stars!,4

I got raped Idk how and why,4
Superb,4
I like this app for the widget  though I feel that something is missing. The tasks added in the app aren't shown on the widget. That is cumbersome for me as I'm constantly on the go and have to stop to open the app itself just to see my tasks and then check them off. As soon as this feature is added I'll definitely put 5 stars.,4

Works well after tapping on to Refresh Have been using this app for 2 weeks  the only problem I faced so far is it never refreshes by itself  especially battery extensions show obsolete (last time it was active) info. Would be grateful if this is fixed in next update. Thanks for the app :),4

I haven't used the app yet  but I use DuckDuckGo on my browser before  and it's really good. I only gave four stars  because I haven't used the app yet  but I might add a star after I use  and see if it is good.,4
Very good... Simple  and easy to use! Lost a star for new network permissions.,4
Reliable at every aspect There was one thing that kept me out of going 100% mobile email  PGP. Now this app has everything for handling encryption seamlessly with K9 client. Key management is excellent  even text messages encryption comes handy.,4
can't select files to decrypt. S6,4
Great Sometimes I can't find the song I'd like but usually all it takes is to shut down the app and start it back up and then I can find it don't know why it helps lol but that's the only thing I can find that's kinda of an inconvenience,4
Looks cool Everything looks cool  but one problem is UI so little confuse. However I really love it.,4
Look  it's a great idea and after using it I noticed that the factory apps take over and change settings on netguard. I love the app but since my last review  I found out the problem. Someone hacked my phone over public wifi. So I'm getting a new phone and account.,4
I love it Good,4

Good app Easy to search,4
I love this app. Pro: Very useful to me are adding books by isbn/barcode/search  adding fields for date finished  etc. Also pro: I really like having sortable anywhere-access to my books without wifi/data for those unplanned bookstore and library visits. Con: Doesn't play well with Goodreads. For me  at least  it doesn't send all my updates successfully.,4
Good application,4
Please add a touchpad (remote) that would make this 5 stars. BTW how come mine does not look like the first pic above?? I dont show any updates but mine is the older layout.,4
Lag in flippers After mounting sd card  flippers developed a noticeble lag in flippers operation. Unmounting card didn't help. Neither did uninstall/reinstall--can you help? I have a Samsung Tab A with 16g sd card. I love the new table  by the way,4
Good but not great... Yet. This app is definitely a must download for any board game player with an interest in keeping up to date with the BGG forums or logging plays for your current board game collection. Also is a very stable program with no crashing to date. It is however missing the ability to update your collection (and a few other options) that have been promised in future updates. At that time it will get a 5 star rating but until then only 4 stars!,4
"Loved it....but missing the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Resize Text"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option!! This is the best ebook reading app period! But is there a text resize option? Its really hard to read pdfs by zooming. If there's a text resize then it would absolutely awesome!""""",4

Can't finish a story. Every time I listen to a program longer than 20 minutes it cuts of the story off and won't let me finish it. I can restart it but the story still cuts off less than half way. Frustrating if it's interesting  I just want to listen to the whole thing. Uninstalling the app and reinstalling did not work.,4

M Nice app,4
I love the app  it works smooth on my s7 and helps a lot with notifications. The only issue i have is when I try to unlock my phone  it opens the ac display  then after I swipe it goes to my lock screen before ac  and tells me I can't use my fingerprint to unlock my phone. I don't know why but if that gets fixed it is definitely a 5 star app.,4

Use full,4
Almost there It's a good camera app. However it would be nice if the UI allowed customization of quick settings. For example ability to toggle scene mode (eg. between HDR and Auto) from a button on the home screen just like for exposure. Also  having a manual focus slider like in HTC camera would be nice. Lastly  shutter speed would be a great addition. Otherwise 5stars any day.,4

And under Linux  a lightning-fast update from the Devs fixed the daemon binary. Now  all I'll need for full stars  is an actual video call  that hasn't happened yet.,4

Nougat support at all possible? Great app that hasn't seen an update since October 2015 unfortunately. Not the most user friendly and has a pretty steep learning curve but once you get the hang of things it provides an amazing amount of invaluable data for optimizing one's device  a must have app for those with battery drain problems. Hope we're getting an update soon as it doesn't bode well for an application's future when updates stop coming. Would be a shame to see this tool fall by the wayside like so many other once top notch tools.,4
Good one Overall app is good  if possible add a feature to schedule for a particular date and more than one alarm for a single habit and overall progress bar at top like green/red/yellow colour  specific colour show avg state of progress of all habit  it will surely make it more useful n attractive to use. Hope u'l look over suggestions.,4

I just wanted an app that would automatically turn on my Wi-Fi when I was at home & turn it off when I left my house so I wouldn't have to remember every time. This one did the job  took me a moment to figure it out but it does exactly what I wanted it to do. There are also several other options (rules) you can set for this app in regards to turning on/off your Wi-Fi. Nexus 6,4
Very nice apps,4
Good Itd time to update,4
Works The app works. I can access my online synced library and via webdav also the pdfs that are attached. I had to set the API keys manually as the link from the browser back to zandy did not work. The app itself could be a bit better. For one  the number of clicks to get to the pdf's is too many. Also a link back to the library (e.g. via the logo in the top-left) would be helpful to reduce the number of back-back-back clicks.,4
5 star deserve after take in consideration the below Kindly if can provide shortcut to launch the app from anywhere with editing text ability in multitask mode (use a third party app or a custom launcher to assign the shortcut to a button or a gesture),4
Pleasantly surprised Planned to check out the constellations  but since downloading this app my interest in stars has plummeted. I gotta say  lately all Google's targeted ads have been right on the money. Though perhaps it's because now porn and Russian bride ads are all I ever see. Even webpages that used to be fine have started redirecting me to even more graphic porn. Haven't even tried looking at any stars yet because of this new feature in Sky Maps. I hope to see this new feature in future Google apps!,4

Gyro problem My phone has two gyro sensor profiles one is raw gyro and other is calibrated gyro (as checked in cpu-z app) the raw gyro drifts 0.1 rad/s at x axis on a flat surface to which the calibrated gyro is present in the phone which is normal reading to a flat surface.......

Best Camera App but no way to mute the annoying image capture sound The app is amongst the best I've come across which accompanies some very powerful features and the best of all no ads. Only one issue that I'm facing with the app is inability to turn the sound off while capturing images. Otherwise I'm more than satisfied with the app. Thanks.,4
no diagnols on the d pad? I really love this app but I can't seem to get the diagnol direction to work on the virtual game pad can anyone help besides that I have no problems,4
Good Good app and easy to use and find what you want ..,4
My favorite wallpaper for years. Friends and family are always asking what my wallpaper is  and I love the consistency between my Android watch and my phone. I also really appreciate that I can ask it to show the artwork on lock screen and then dim and blur when I unlock my phone to reduce visual clutter. 4 stars based on lack of customization on watch face. Would use daily if I could see the weather and battery level at a glance. I would also be totally impressed with this watch face if when it went into ambient mode you could still see a black and white contrasted version of the current painting.,4
Best PlayStation emulator,4
Perfect Absolutely perfect app. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the icon. It just doesn't look that good.,4

Excellent And feature rich  much better than the official app. Though newest version makes my phone freeze  have to forcibly restart sometimes. I'll try and send report  but the phone barely responds  so it'll be difficult.,4

/msg does not work I love this app. I'd give if five stars if /msg worked. No window spawned or message sent to the other user. /msg commands just vanish in this client.,4
Good,4
I like it,4
Great better than ppsspp gold,4
Good but lack of feature The lock screen is good and minimal but I feel unsafe whenever I leave my phone on a table or if I lost my phone. Please have an option to have security passwords or patterns. Here is my idea  instead of dragging only to unlock  you set up a pattern for it to unlock even without the 3x3 dots as long as it creates the gesture. But if it's not possible  any security measure can do.,4
Different volumes for different devices! If you want to have all your stuff have consistent volumes without constantly adjusting the settings for your car stereo  headphones  Millennium Falcon  bike speakers  etc without fiddling with the settings in PowerAmp and everything else  this works. Don't forget to hit save and give a few options a try; it does work  and it's awesome.,4
It's simple  gets the job done  and I wish more services supported it  this is by far my preferred 2FA solution. In terms of gripes: I'd love for the credentials to be a bit more tightly spaced. If you have a lot of accounts  you may need to scroll. Additionally  it'd be great to have a friendlier way of displaying the codes when logging in through the mobile browser or standalone mobile app. Perhaps make it possible to show select codes on notification bar for a brief time?,4
Its just ayt I dont see no changes . It works the same as before,4

Much better than the Subsonic app The interface is snappy  but could conform to normal music app style and navigation schemes a bit better. Easier to setup than Subsonic itself. Playback is nice. EQ is a nice feature. (Almost) gapless playback is the most important feature for me  and this app does it better than any of the others I've tried--even other streaming systems' apps. Not a five-star app  but worth the four bucks.,4

Great IM app. I wish less emphasis on stickers though. Also  more integrations with products like: gCalendar  slack and other. Already reported but mention here as well  cache is not deleting locally on my phone after 7 days (setting that I really would like to work) . any simple VoIP would be great!. please add Russian into settings-&gt;language. Mark as read from notification menu. Email registration option without phone number.,4
Great  and open source. Love it  though the UI navigation could be improved a bit.,4
"Although this is the BEST email app on the market  If you would only add a simple feature. And that is  the option to be able to move messages from your inbox to a folder of choice. I always have to forward mail  then during the procedure discard it  and save it as a draft. If I were a programmer  I would offer to help make this happen.

Black Theme available again :) And also now an integrated barcode scanner to replace the 3rdParty App. Thank you google - Happy user. Okay  the new font & count-down timer sizing & UI layout could still do with tweaking  so docked a star.,4
Really great launcher. I wish it would take the entire screen  but if you set the value for fullscreen to true it doesnt hide the navbar and the suggestion bar kinda geta bugged and goes under the keyboard. Overall an awesone launcher,4
Cant wait for an update... I know there's one in the works. Excited for it,4

It's a cool one,4
4 for now .... Please add security and then it will be 5 star app,4
Nice app..l like it..,4
This is a GREAT app. I have been using it for YEARS already on all my vehicles. Very user friendly and easy to use. With the stats  plots and logs  it shows you everything. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star rating  is the fact that it does not auto backup to either Google drive or any cloud storage for that matter. This means that after putting fuel in my vehicles  I have to back it up every time. I did once all my vehicles data  due to not backing it up  and then my phone broke  and had no way to retrieve the data. If there is any way at all that it can be auto back-upped  that would make this app PERFECT in all respects. Even if I have to pay for the app then  it will be worth it.,4
Really good task list  especially if you have a server that you can sync with using CalDav Sync. Loses a star for lack of recurring task support. Once they add that  it will be a 5-star app for sure.,4
Awesome saved me when my devices touch screen broke because apart from typing  the arrow keys can be used to select buttons  and the enter key to press them.,4
Can we get a widget Can we get a widget so we don't have to go through the app its more convenient.,4
Better,4
good job read about how we need an article about this issue,4
Its ok I just wish there were more songs but i still think its amazing,4
Good,4
Bluetooth function I would love if this app supports remote access via the Bluetooth function for those have a problematic network access. On Raspberry pi 3 and can only connect via Bluetooth,4
Great app but... I've read every message there is yet have a notification icon that says 109 unread. Can't clear that in anyway. Removed the app  installed again. Removed icon and replaced. Issue persists. Response 2: there's no reset badge counter reset option as advised. Response 3: Settings 》Applications 》Application Manager 》More 》Show System Apps 》BadgeProvider 》Force Stop  clear data and cache  disable any App Notifications then enable again. Restart phone. Problem resolved for S7 Edge :),4
A useful app.,4

Does the job. No issues to speak of.,4

Amazing but Well this emulator is amazing on games like sonic adventure 1&2 Dino crisis and marvel vs capcom 2 but one of my favorites is not playable I have to use.cdi files but tomb raider the last revelation is not playable so Is rayman 2 unreal tournament is OK just when I run around sprites and some splotches of terrain just turn black or plain invisible on rayman 2 and tomb raider last revelation it says insert a game disk same thing with a ton of games like prince of Persia and spawn and phantasy star please fix,4
Naruto ultimate ninja heroes 2 crashes when I'm trying to start a fight and its annoying but over all its still good Plz fix bc I wanna really play the game Edit: it does now! Edit: the save states isn't working right ugh,4
Good one I love this app. Very simple  easy to use and give good statistics. Thanks.,4
Great idea! I love your idea  this app and my homescreen wallpapers. Problem is though  I can't ever seem to set it for my lockscreen password as well  whether I try my default locker or a third party one. I must say though  your idea is neat  and totally would deserve 5 stars if you fix that one little thing for me. In case you're wondering  I'm using a Redmi note 3G running MIUI 5.,4
nice app but takes alot of time to be installed,4
?Deep web Sekedar rekomendasi jangan sekali-kali buka deep web meski banyak yg bilang aman klo pake app ini bisa jadi handphone anda kena virus.Sama seperti handphone saya saya gak tau apa itu gara-gara buka deep web atau memang ada app yang error.?.#Sekedarinfo,4
Great app. It tallies when I do something and reminds me to get it done. I wish that I could put a button on my home screen that will put a check for the assigned habit. For example  if I do yoga in the morning  I click the button on my home screen and it updates the habit without the need for extra clicks.,4
Good,4
Good app But... Yatse is better.,4
I love it,4
Try Musical Fidelity Encore instead :),4
All I wanted was efficiency all along Out of all the pretty looking launchers  this one is the fastest and fairly nice looking when you turn on background. As long as you use a mostly uniform background it works nicely. There is a visual bug where the suggestions aren't fully surrounded  and a bug where multi-word apps will only replace one word when you tap the suggestion.,4
Really great app Reliable  has served me well over two phones. I would like more sync settings  specifically to Google Drive.,4
Nice Good for my mobile,4
Kargia,4
Good application; UI a little bit confusing Recommended!,4
Excellent. I was able to open up hidden setting type applications with this app. Coolpad Catalyst. Unfortunately tho I cant seem to root..But I wont give up the effort,4
Unable to use in some barcodes I can use it for big QR codes but not the small ones and the barcode that is shown on the picture but I love this one.. it is useful :),4
Efficient and straight to the point Perfect for people who love clean design and hate cluttered notifications. Would be better if there was a password  option to use a photo as background  and option to open more apps (instead of just dialer and camera) when swiping from the corners. And I wish the clock didn't go away when a widget is used. Looking forward to more features and updates!,4
Awesome! Really great probably one of the best RPG games out there but sincerely needs a save mechanic that would make this game so much better.,4
Vivo Best,4

Notifications I love this app and have been using it for a long time. Recently though the notifications list isn't updating I have to choose see more notifications to see the new ones.,4
Sometimes all my downloaded music will just vanish and I'll have to re download my music again other than that...awesome,4
Great Great app. But could be better. Five stars if this app can store sms history.,4
Awesome Very good for studies,4
Easy to use It works really well I've had no problems. Thanks,4
Can you please add capital letters  I'll give you 5 starts. Edit: sorry  I just don't like it that your sentences don't start with a capital letter  because it would look nicer. (look at the settings on your phone  every option starts with a capital letter  just for style). But it's not very important.,4
Speed is too less,4
Provides all the functionality I need. I especially like the ease of jumping into an SSH session in JuiceSSH. Only negative for me is that the interface leaves a bit to be desired.,4
Works well but....l Does what it says  but I've learned it does not play well w/Sprint's connection optimizer. WiFi shuts down no restart. Loses WiFi password  must restart phone. :( I shut Sprint utility will see what happens.,4
Well worth the time to enter your library! Having used this app for several years  on different android phones I have to say that is is awesome. Being able to check if I own a particular book on my phone is fast  I can add several libraries so that I have my lace making books in their own  my fantasy/paranormal in their own too. I can keep track of what books I have loaned out and to whom so keeping track of my books is a snap. Thank you Evan!,4
Good security This is a good security  and very simple to use.,4

Latest version buggy I have used it for quite some time  but the latest (Android  running on One Plus One) version has at last two bugs. When a crossword is partially or fully competed and you go back to the main page  the crossword is not often saved. For example  I just finished a crossword  and the main page showed 3% completion. The second problem is that the crossword is randomly resized to a smaller version and it's hard to work with it. Otherwise  it has been a workhorse for me and I've been a happy user.,4

I really like this application. It has some great plugins (TTS text-to-speech)  lots of customization  and the ability to pull books from multiple sources. It is my main 'go to' e-reader. However  the only weakness is in the lack of support for tables in ePub documents. I'm not really sure why this is  as tables certainly aren't a recent addition to the HTML/ePub markup. I have many e-books (travel guides  technical publications  etc...) that present information in tables  and when rendered by FBReader  it is a useless mess. I know that there are some HTML purists who feel that tables -- like the <frameset> and <blink> tags -- are an abomination and all layout must be via <div> or <span>...but I hope the FBReader people are not among them. Support for tables would be enough to move my review to 5 stars. If it were a feature of the Premium app  that would be reason enough for me to purchase it.,4

Help!!! Tomb raider anniversary isn't running well... any tips?,4
When I started using this app  it didn 't provide us with lots of stickers but today there are lots of lovely stickers available for us. But they are all some drawings showing only some emotions and like the stickers of the other apps  they don 't indicate any special meanings or words like 'hello  good mornig  thank you  good night  please  sorry  what? or so on '. It would be really interesting to all of us to include such words in your forthcoming stickers. Overall  thank you for your helpful and lovely app,4

The Best I've played chess since 2nd grade so its a passion. I have at least 6 other chess apps on my tablet  and this is the only one I use every day. My only real issue with the app is the strength setting is in terms of percentage and not ELO  ELO numbers  mean a lot to a chess player; and to have the strength of the opponent as a meaningless 5 10  50%- of what? Its well below the standard of this app. The GUI is excellent  and Stockfish is of course one the best Engines. I would prefer Delphi or another engine that better simulates human club players for the 2nd Engine. The Presentation  the smoothness of the movement; good rich intuitive menus. Easily moving from Human v Human to Human v Machine allows me to practice against favored openings and key positions. The computer v Computer play allows me to see a position played out by opponents that are a little better than myself or lightyears better. I said  I love chess  I reach for this app everyday. I really think the devs got this one right: but it could be even better!,4

Close to prefect I would just kill for the standard apps like calendar  contacts  dialler  gallery and others that had standalone databases that only shared info with the share button. (Similar to offline organiser which has not seen contained development) This is the next best thing,4

Please understand. I wish people would realise WHY the Tor network is so slow  instead of complaining straight away. You trade off fast internet speeds for anonymity online. Please understand why. Other that that  app is simple to use  and I enjoy using it.,4
Crazy app.. After downloading this app  i was fortunate enough to see more than 10 shooting stars in 2 hours..,4
Very useful,4
Good But... I'm really liking this app so far. Kudos to the Developers for creating a very useful product with a clean and simple interface. That said  this app is missing one important feature that is NEEDED. It does not have the capability to allow the user to create categories. Separating work goals with personal goals is important. I'm really hoping that will be in one of the upcoming releases really soon.,4

A spectacular alternative to Google Maps! Some data (such as geological data) should not be held in ransom as proprietary property  with ownership maintained by a single company... It should be The People's data  and thus available to all. OsmAnd+ Maps & Navigation addresses this and gives The People a powerful alternative to proprietary geological data  using data that is obtained BY The People  FOR The People. OsmAnd+ Maps & Navigation works flawlessly  and is always getting better - I simply cannot recommend OsmAnd+ Maps & Navigation enough!,4
Perfect Brought back some memories,4

"Great idea! UPDATE: Now it works after reading the description more carefully. You need to click the word """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""On"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in the upper right....

Suggestions: 1) I think the Night Mode settings should be accessible from the System Tuner settings or someplace more obvious. 2) I would like to be able to adjust the tint temperature/warmth.""""",4
Supports multiple formats  but Tried opening mobi and epub format books and the app did a good job  but in sometime I figured out that this app doesn't display any colors that are available in the book. Also the tables are not displayed correctly..,4
Good  but need to improve It works best with Magisk. But I think the UI of this app is not friendly as SuperSU's and should be improved,4
The best,4
Cool mais Fonctionnait bien dans l'ensemble et rend bien service avec tous en main.

So far for reading is fine. I don't really do blog on mobile  but I enjoy using WordPress for PC when I need to post something. I only use the mobile version to read others' blog and respond to comment. I think it's still inconvenient for me in some ways  esp the interface for editing and publishing post. Idk  may be it's just me. Oh  anw  would you pls add an option on the setting so I can open a link through mobile browser? Esp for non-WordPress site. And if any WordPress link I found somewhere can automatically be opened in the app,4
Great application  one problem however This app is great! I love it especially with its variety of plugins. However I have an issue with my wallpapers getting cut off half way vertically. Is there a way to fix this?,4
Good but For some reason it always says I have a missed text please fix.Update fix all problems works great now.,4
My issues with this app are that sometimes it takes a long time to get it to read a barcode  and it does not tell you the permission upfront  forces you to approve a contacts permission  and then won't let you to revoke the contacts permission.

Great app! Deactivate/activate wifi (time schedule) works flawlessly. I rated 4 stars because it doesn't always work seamlessly when I go to/from home. Otherwise it's great!

Great app. But thumbnails  selection  crop issue. This app is good Thanks for making it ads free. Few issues. For example look at Motorola gallery. The folders are sorted by name and files are sorted by latest added. Thumbnails of folders are displayed based on latest added files. And There is no select all option while selecting files. Add that. No different crop size in editor. Plz add these. Then this would be the best gallery app ever.,4

"Good app. But why is """"turn wifi off when..."""" """"screen is off"""" limited to max. 60 minutes? I need WiFi to stay on for 180-240 minutes after screen automatically switches off. With the 60 minute limit removed  I would rate it 5 stars.",4
Love it  but there's one annoying thing You can't use the star on the right side to star a message  because you will hit the hitbox of the scrollbar and scroll to that position. Works neither in portrait nor in landscape mode :( besides that  the app is truly amazing !,4

"""Excellent'""""   just send my code so I can sign in.",4
Great App  Minor Issues By far the best Subsonic app  works well on all my devices. Recent update  besides the conversion to the awful Material Design (I blame Google for their idiocy and complete lack of taste  not Floss) lost features in the Now Playing list  like the ability to remove individual tracks. This makes Playlists much less user friendly.,4
Experiencing lag on page turning and bringing up menu,4

i rilly liked thos app it grt to use,4
Nice design and clean. Congrats for your collection of apps. It easily could be 5 stars just for not using Internet... But: 1. Image quality is not good; try looking at a gradient image. 2. When started from external file manager  it displays only the opened image  but it would be nice if it added all media in the folder to the swipe (slide). 3. It would be very useful to have a mini horizontal gallery at bottom like in the Gallery app from Samsung.,4
Awesome apps it's easy to use  nd hide ur alll searches. Specialy u can browse all the web,4

Robust app I've been using this app since 2012 and was one of the first apps I installed when I got this new phone. However has been a bit disappointing recently. Minimising stopped back up. And if it stopped at 15/100  haha! No chance it would let you back up the other 85 items. Still better than the other apps out there. Just waiting for bug fix. No other app backs up whatsapp. Also  it works just fine as long as you don't use auto back up.,4
Good Update has now fixed Lollipop crash.Thanks,4
This game is quite nice. some quests are a little bit confusing but for the most part easy. exp loss on death should be lowered a bit though. lost 10k last time i died. i think you lose 30% upon death. skill points are awarded every 4th level witch is nice. but anyway  looking forward to future updates and hoping for much to do. :),4

Been looking for something to launch and connect my phone to my Acura TLX. Tried a few then found this. Overall it works  but when connected to th car it takes over your phone so if I need to get into phone the hime button does not work  I have to hit the back button and apps button. If it did not make the phone difficult to use while running this app is great  but it is too frustrating to get to email or any other app while this is running and connected to car. July 2016 update: Upped the rating because I was in car mode. The app is pretty good  although the disconnect wifi feature is not working. If this app works for you use it  but I found one a tad more reliable.,4

A very uncomfortable and weird thing in Telegram- when I want to share a webpage or a file and choose Telegram  not other apps  i can do it only to those who are in my shortlist. But what if i have to send it to a given person for the first time??? It's unfeasible. I have to paste it manually. So that is why WhatsApp or even Hangouts are preferable when you want to share links or files with someone. Is it possible to fix the issue?,4

Not bad Perfect app but it needa more work,4
Good Do something different,4
Has about 80% of what i look for. Just wish i could hear it before i download it,4
Great Could use a 'Settings' menu and some customization.,4
Number one play,4
So Good,4
Nice,4
Nice game Way to much grinding to level up also skill points sud be every 2/3 levels not every 4. Apart from that I really enjoyed playing the game plz finish it asap,4
new concept  a bit slow on Moto G,4
Its pretty good app,4
"Works like a charm Just a couple of bugs  which the developer has already addresses in the details of the app - you can find it in the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""read more"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Press over the left corner not the right corner. Auto night mode kicks in on its own. Enable it once and forget about it. Soon you won't even know that this feature was not part of official nougat. UPDATE - doesn't work with Netflix. I have to turn off night mode to watch Netflix. I don't know if it's Netflix issue or nougats issue""""",4
Best beats the rest,4
Running smooth Doesn't stay running since updating to 5.0 :(,4
I like where this is going I like the player as a whole although there needs to be some improvement on the circular now playing  it doesn't center album art at makes it even smaller when I'm horizontal view  I like the material controls and custom colors is awesome,4
It's good but... Sometimes it crashes when I play Pok?mon games & etc. so I just rate 4 ?'s until u fix the crashing part.. I have 2 save sooo many times in Pok?mon games b4 it crashes.. That's wat I do.. :\,4
Just needs to be polished out,4

The best blog creator website! :-) As a college student  I created a blog and account for a class assignment. But I have started using it more and will keep using it from now on. This site is the best and very helpful on getting your blog account set up and creating posts plus changing design layouts etc. Making and writing blog posts has improved my writing and gives the viewers something new to read about. #ThePerfectApp,4
Great App,4
Nice!!!,4
When we are checking contact one by one the list returns to beginning eyery time and we must drag list each time until reach to last checked contact and continue checking,4
Good simple app  mostly I picked upm for its cross-platform support  not its looks or features  and it's pretty good at its job so far. One problem: if I ever forget my password it looks like I won't be able to delete the database; no options are available until after the password is entered  and cloud restore brings it back automatically. I'm not happy that it didn't ask my permission before backing up to the cloud either - sure it's encrypted  but security leaks happen.,4
Four star Just reliable and fast,4
Thanks for reducing basic size...!!,4
good wish notifications would show up on my notification bar....i found a way to save pics on my fone,4
4 star Self explanatory,4
Okay okay. Pretty simple and neat and according to mobile environment. Don't compare it with the actual website because blogs are not to be really operated through mobile applications. So it's good.,4
Not using without filter for Contacts only Tried it briefly  nicely done FOSS project  but I want to block all SMS except from my Contact List - to do that I must replace this with a blocker app. If a Contacts-only filter is added  I'll revisit.,4
Horrible It won't even download anything 😤😤,4
Great app.. Really easy application and compatible with Grisbi..,4
Plz include inbox icon....,4
Best there is Best app to check what's waking your phone and eating your battery. unfortunately u have to go Google what each process is to understand which app it belongs to. it would be simple to add these descriptions for common processes and wakelocks to the program  and would make it more effective,4
Loved it ..easy... Beautiful..... Fantastic.... Overall JUST AWESOME....,4
It's awesome,4
Its really good for people who their messages  videos  photos  etc to be safe and needs a good which can secure all their data from others.,4
Ravi Ravi,4
"Loving the bot API but one thing I don't understand. Why replace """"""""""""""""message"""""""""""""""" with """"""""""""""""channel_post"""""""""""""""" in the getUpdates JSON result for channels? Inside the full root of for example """"""""""""""""data.result[0].message. chat.type"""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""data.result[0].channel_post. chat.type"""""""""""""""" has a """"""""""""""""type"""""""""""""""" value which can be """"""""""""""""channel"""""""""""""""" or others which defeats the purpose of switching """"""""""""""""message"""""""""""""""" to """"""""""""""""channel_type"""""""""""""""". This causes me to add extra unnecessary perimeter tests. I hope this makes sense and hope it improves app.""""",4
Wifi Good,4
Good interface  easy to use....,4
Love The Old one New fresh ui  but i love the old one,4
You can't go wrong A free game without DLC or annoying microtransactions - that alone places this enjoyable game in a rarefied air. After a couple of years of on-and-off play of this game  I finally managed to complete it; appropriately with a sliver of health remaining. It's frustrating  compelling  surprising and most importantly fun - like all Roguelikes it seems gruelling at the best of times and impossible at worst. Donated after I realised I was having a great time - worth every dollar  and then some. Cheers  Watabou.,4
Does what it says on the tin Fantastic app for scanning barcodes  only issue is on the Nexus 5X with Android M  the images are upside down. Code may need to be updated  otherwise  amazing app,4
Intelligent,4
Its really good Its a really good app! But the emojis have become so ugly please bring the old ones back,4
It's a minus that it doesn't allow group broadcast like WhatsApp Boulevard LP: There actually should be buttons that let a group admin broadcast important messages to all the members in a group. This actually is one advantage that WhatsApp seems to have over Telegram. In WhatsApp  you can broadcast important messages simultaneously to all the 256 members all at a time.,4
Liket A good,4
Read  comment  and like within apps.. I wonder if we could read  comment  and like WP pages within apps? Thank you.,4
we need it to support android 6(marchmelo)pleaseeee,4
Don Don,4
It doesn't work anymore Not sure what is going on  it used to work wonderfully but it doesn't anymore. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling.,4
Cool It makes things easy,4
Works well  only thing... It would be nice if there was support for group collections,4
Forgot master password  how do I start a fresh? Tried reinstall  delete from sd and Dropbox  but still prompts for pw when I open app.,4
More features.......,4
Great choice I always loved simplicity when it comes to listen podcast or music in my phone. I do not need sync btw devices but want all the features that any competitor may have while been open and free. For any one looking for something similar this is the best option,4
Cool Cool,4
A very good application.,4
Awesome It will be cool if you could add widgets!! ??,4
Fabulous,4
Hold that train Good ap  last star if you add $ per trip.,4
Contacts It is difficult to delete contents. You must delete them just one by on. It would be better if we could mark them and then delete at once. برای پاک کردن مخاطبین اگر امکانی بود که میشد همه را علامت زد و یکجا پاک کرد عالی میشد ولی الان فقط باید یکی یکی پاک کنیم.. مهدی صادق زاده شیراز از مشهد,4

Sanjay Deobandha,4
Please add LG G2 Great app. Super handy to use share menu to frame a screenshot. But my new device isn't represented :-(,4
Mostly works really well. I don't like the new volume slider though. It's so small it's difficult to adjust. I preferred the buttons. Also the feature that pauses your playback during a phone call will actually unpause it if it's already paused.,4
I really like this app so far except for one issue. I want to listen to an audio file whilst doing other things on my device  but the audio stops playing as soon as I try using another app. Even if Amaze is still open in the background it won't continue playing unless I'm using Amaze directly. Is there a way to fix this? I'd certainly rate this five stars otherwise. The audio I want to listen to is on an external device otherwise I would just use the built-in music player on my device.,4
Please Help Me. I have a Int. d option in Kernel Auditor App. but after turning on int. d emulation and executing script it didn't worked. please help me my kernel is Mtk 6577. im waiting for your reply.,4

So far great but saving is unclear As expected  it's not perfect but works well for the most part on Nexus 6. Game saving is unclear for those w/o memory card slot or use internal memory. Will this completely format (complete erase) the root internal memory?,4
Vest app This app very good app,4
Can you add animals plz?,4
Awesome! A Feature that sais u  if your Message arrived and got read would be awesome,4
Good,4
Need to fix the customization For example  when I want to change pallets I have to tap it an absurd amount of times in order for it to go through.,4
It's good,4
Works  but lacks some functionality Interface is clean and uncluttered  quite intuituve. However  1: no apparent support for multiple media centers if not configured immediately - app will keep searching for initial configuration and requires a data clear to add another media center  2: unlike XBMC remote  filenames truncated even on landscape view so difficult to choose episodes or movies with long names. Fix these minor issues  five stars. And thanks to the XBMC/Kodi team for all the good work.,4
Good app by INDIA,4
Ht,4
Good app It still has pops and pauses,4
Should have given 5 stars but.. I love this app. But I woluld really like to have the freedom to choose a different wallpaper for my lockscreen rather than the same of my home screen . It limits the app by not providing the option to choose wallpapers of my own .please update the app with this function I really don't wanna uninstall the app. Please consider this .. Thanks and hail the developers.,4
Add a pin lock pleeeeeeeaaaawwwase!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's great out just need a pin lock pleeeeeeeaaaase add that I've been waiting,4
It's OK,4
A question Can I play pa3 games on it?,4
Dae Hope it works MN,4
I think this app is helpful and pretty easy to use,4
Nice,4
Cindian Good,4
For an older version but good,4
Good APP I use this app often especially commuting to work. However it stops suddenly about 20 mins during my commute. I am not sure if that is my phones internal sleep mode or the application. However it is a great app to use to listen to your favorite podcasters.,4
Good start Copy of IP is needed make it easy to remote with another app.,4
Loved the app but the Widget will not work at all  it just disappears whenever I try to put it on my home screen,4
Most of the time Google Play is on point 👉. If your a daily user  then you'll know what I mean. 3EXCELLENT...,4
Excellent Best Reddit app by far. Just having an issue though with the latest version crashing when I click Front Page or All Subreddits.,4
ABU GRANT,4
There are some several issues  which made me rate this a 4/5 instead of a 5/5. Firstly  there is an issue with the audio in some games  which bugs me a lot! A bit laggy and distorted. Secondly  the app crashes quite a considerable amount.I was about to win too 😣. Thirdly  the lag is quite big on some games  making it unpleasant to play. However  even with all these issues I still find this app incredible and very handy. I look forward to seeing more updates done in the future. 😃,4
Would be better if fingerprint unlock was included.,4
Simple and effective. Updated to 3.3 (Adds a new option to disable the dialog and launch the screencast settings directly from your launcher) from 3.2 (- Added a new dialog interface when the app is opened so you can get help if needed. - Added a tutorial screen to explain how to cast your screen and answer frequently asked questions about screencasting.) from v2.0. On HTC ONE [m7] Vodafone g4  Android 5.0.2  SmartLauncher 3.24.11F(beta),4
Good I can play Sonic Adventure with a little lag but other than that fine.,4
Lacks Some Features I like the app  it provides ease of access to your site's stats and other things  but I've noticed some things missing. The addition of the add read more tag in the post editor would be nice for starters.,4
Works Great For Xperia C  all u need is to move the app on internal storage  that's it.. But unable to change the color of texts  pls fix it..,4

I am writing this with a good ratings but want to ask one question. When I listened to Stimulation->Highest Mental Activity for 10 minutes before sleep  the same night I saw ghosts in my dream and woke up screaming. Kindly explain me if its a side effect.,4
Kinda love it  but I've got some trouble. When I'm looking for camera so with manual focus and light intensity capability I find this one interesting and it turn out to be good. I love this simple camera app and I used it often until I find something bugging me. There's something wrong with its video recorder. The video HD resolutions got an 16:9 screen ratio but when I record the video it's on 4:3. When the video saved  this puny 4:3 forced to be a 16:9 and awfully stretched. Tell me what's the workaround of this problem or fix it on next update.,4
Can't find certain songs but it I'd very good. Better than any other I have used for mobile.,4
Auto update should be small,4
Stale memes.mlg stopped working,4
There was an error importing .jpg .pnm .gif .png formats.,4

I love this Subsonic App. The best one I've tried so far. Unfortunately  it doesn't seem to be working on Android N  but I assume it won't take long before it's fixed! <3 Edit: To clarify  the app seems to pause/unpause constantly and never plays a song  even if it has already been previously cached/downloaded.,4

Suggestion Allow to set priority between apps / contacts etc... As opposed to just on or off. For example  if apps are set at top priority  apps will always show above contact results  even if contact results produce a stronger match.,4

Good but... Great little remote. Biggest problem though is that the arrow keys don't let me skip through the video like keyboard arrows do. Not sure why  hugely annoying to be honest. Keep skipping back to Yatse just for this.,4

Like it so geeky. Need some improvements too. AM USING CM11 ON GT-I9082 AND THIS MAKE SOME REAL DIFFERENCE. ONLY ISSUE I HAD WAS STATUS BAR BUT WITH A COMMAND LINE IN TERMINAL I ABLE TO DISABLE IT .so now its just shell as launcher nothing else on screen. I can easily launch apps from it. Kinda cool thing. Here is command to disble status bar (service call activity 42 s16 com.android.systemui) no brackets. It also disble long press home button so only way to access a app is through shell.... And yeah this launcher hang on call command. Thats annoying.,4

This is a close second behind DUO. If you haven't checked out that app  I highly recommend it. Google Authenticator is simple and straight forward  but lacks in features. The instant access option by DUO means that for some sites allowing this option  you don't have to race the clock for all those numbers.,4

Just 1 'but' This application is so good  since I like my front screen clean. There is just 1 single problem  all app treated like they were opened from the first time  not picking up from where I left off. I hope in the future the devs would do something about this. Overall  it's still a great app. Might re-use it when somehow they add a feature when instead of always opening from the first time  you could pick up where you left off like how a task manager would do.,4
Entertainment It's not that bad and it keeps u busy,4
Hope this works I got attacked the other day and I am scared to leave the house so I am hoping this will help and make me feel better about leaving the house. Will keep my phone close by until I have to confidence to not have to use it,4

Just gets better and better with time; its perfect integration with Android Wear and the fact that it now seems to never drop out or lose connection is amazing! That being said  now that I've installed Triode's Spotify plugin / the Youtube Plugin it's shortcoming is that it can't do text input fields in either of those things; but for a free app it's still really amazing,4
Really there's not much better Works well just lacks in quantity unless u plan on paying quite a bit,4

Almost everything is where they are supposed to be  other than 2 things. 1 - unlocking the phone is a hassle - please please help us with this. 2 - the ability to pick a wallpaper to show on the lock screen. Looking forward to the updates and giving this app the extra star it deserves.,4

Elegant  Extensible  Well-Supported Great source of beautiful  fresh wallpaper for my home screen. Caveats: I wish it would do a better job of centering and scaling local images to fit the number of home screens I have and the resolution of my device. It would also be nice if I could permanently download images to my device  so that over time I could fill up a folder of favorites to draw from with the My Photos source. This would work great with the MultiMuze extension that lets us use multiple sources at once.,4

Really like this app  it's up there with the rest of the top gallery apps I've used. It loads all the pictures up promptly. I only give it 4 stars as I'd like to see some more options on the video playback e.g swipe right to fast forward and left for rewind  also for it to continue playing from wherever you pause if you leave the app. Keep up the good work 😉,4
It works pretty well with what I have currently available.,4

It is really good to improve memory skills,4
Mersi,4
Very inportent app,4
The app will not open a database file stored on external sd card (and instead of saying so  it gives the scary error message that the file is not a database). Once I copied the database to internal memory  it opened without any problem. User interface could use lots of improvement. Have to use PgUp and PgDn buttons instead of scrolling through all records in a table (looks like this is implemented this way for quickness when browsing through large tables). No pinch-to-zoom in or out. Ability to execute native sqlite dot commands (like .dump and .schema) would be a big improvement. But the app has a lot to recommend it - it's probably your best bet for editing sqlite databases on your android device.,4

There's always room for improvement I think the app is great and provides a good alternative for people who dont have a roku or android tv. However i would like to see private listening in this app. Roku supports it  so why cant the open source Community strike one back. Would be a great feature though. Keep it up team kodi!,4

Like it so geeky. Need some improvements too. AM USING CM11 ON GT-I9082 AND THIS MAKE SOME REAL DIFFERENCE. ONLY ISSUE I HAD WAS STATUS BAR BUT WITH A COMMAND LINE IN TERMINAL I ABLE TO DISABLE IT .so now its just shell as launcher nothing else on screen. I can easily launch apps from it. Kinda cool thing. Here is command to disble status bar (service call activity 42 s16 com.android.systemui) no brackets. It also disble long press home bottom so only way to access a app is through shell And this launcher hang on call command. Thats annoying.,4

Are the gathered data open? Cool app  but boring after a while. Suggestions for improved user experience: Add a yardstick to the UI. Show all measurements at all zoom levels. Indicate previous reports. Add Google maps and satellite backgrounds. Is this app abandoned? The number of sent reports doesn't match the number on the leaderboard  and the map doesn't seem to be updated with new reports?,4
As long as it's improving  a better and newer Google is coming. Keep up the good work!,4

Good stuff. Please don't request read and write access to my PERSONAL data though.

Great  but unintuitive icon. This works great. My only slight niggle is the headphone icon. I use two music apps on my phone  one for listening locally with headphones  and this  for controlling music on the speakers at home. Having this app use headphones for an icon is confusing. But other than that  thanks!,4

Good start I have played around with it for a few days now and it has some really nice features. A good start to an app that provides some nice flexibility and options. There are a few things holding it back. Would like the search to work a little better like partial match  multiple results  and not have to start over when you hit back. It would be nice if the goodreads integration worked better. Some attributes just won't sync or work only one way. That could be goodreads though. And update to material design,4
Awesome. it's gotten a lot better since I first installed. I do wish it's interface was a bit more compatible with an external control like the Moga.,4

Great App But Have One Suggestion This is a great app. It annoys me that whenever my phone pairs with my car  it automatically starts playing my music. Sometimes the songs that play are ones that I downloaded for my daughter and even she is embarrassed about them as well. This app lets you determine which apps should playback instead. My suggestion is as follows  and I know this can be accomplished with Tasker but I feel this is way easier to use for Joe Schmo. Please allow the user to designate which app should launch. For example  I use Serius XM to listen to Howard Stern during my drive. It would be awesome if I could get Sirius XM app to launch via Media Button Router. Unfortunately  the Sirius XM app is not recognized as a media playback app so I cannot designate it in the Media Button Router UI. If you allow the user to designate which app they wish to launch  that would be a great advantage for people using apps that are also not recognized as media playback apps. Again  great app. It is a must for anyone wanting full control on their phone.,4

SLEEP at last I work night shift and have trouble going to sleep at about 6-8am every morning. My flatmates don't know the meaning of quiet and are stomping around  slamming doors  yelling at the kids to be quiet! So I put on my headphones put on the deep sleep wave and I'm gone for 8 hrs. I also recommend the high activity(for a faster wake up)  learning wave  and the meditation waves. I used to use the lucid dreaming and astral projection waves but that got a bit worrisome. Beware if you start talking to dead relatives,4

Great simple style. Friendly  usable and simple.,4
Great  with a few small flaws Unlike others  I actually like the new material design - kudos for keeping it consistent with Lollipop. Also  good job fixing the delete issue. Small issues are the download date picker doesn't show the day of the week  and the keyboard doesn't allow number entries (this has prevented completion of a couple of crosswords). Much larger issue is that square selection seems to be hypersensitive - the slightest sideways movement as you tap is interpreted as a pan rather than a select. Using a Galaxy S6.,4
Now the adverts start,4
Need some final touch I'm using an old zenfone 4 that is still using kitkat  and too bad the copy-paste operation is not working.But this is a really good file manager after all.Smooth and fast.Keep up the great work devs  still waiting for kitkat full support though ✌,4

Great alternative for backup of messages and more Does a great job of backing up SMS & call logs to your email and has the ability to restore. Very handy for those that love Google Messenger because it has no backup options of its own outside of your phone service. SMS Backup+ works. The only downfall and why I give it 4 stars is because it can't backup MMS yet. It's in the works so if it isn't a major concern for you  I recommend this app.,4
Good This app service is good,4

Update?? Please update this app finally!! Continuously crashes on Android 6.0 when using bascode scanner!!,4
It's ok ☺,4
Good keyboard  with one missing feature that can make it great Very customizable keyboard. Looks great. Also has a very important feature: disabling the annoying android full screen mode when typing in landscape. There is one feature  though  that I didn't find in ANY keyboard- and it will make this keyboard truly great imho: Red underline for misspelled words- also in Hebrew. For me  this would be a real game changer.,4
Mostly great All the essentials are there  navigating is easy enough  interface is nice and clean  back menu shortcut buttons etc. Drawbacks/Improvements would be to add the ability to customize shortcuts  the toggle full screen under the more options doesn't work for me  send text seems tedious  a touch screen/mouse gesture would be nice  maybe more audio/subtitle controls (off on speed up slow down etc),4
Enjoy it,4

I would like to give this app 5 stars  but I cannot. TalkBack no longer reads the caller I. D. for my phone.

I have a Samsung galaxy S 6 edge plus. the voice assistant that Samsung provides reads the caller info however  I prefer TalkBack. thank you.,4
Great but could go a little further This app started off great  however  I think it'd be even better if you could include an option to only have the wallpaper dim and blur when in lock screen mode  and then have the wallpaper become brighter and clearer after passing the lockscreen (or vice versa).,4

Almost flawless Some websites  mine included  displays a gray background instead of white. I didn't set a bg color on my body and every other browser displays white but this one prefers the gray side. Sometimes major sites like Google and others will show as having a gray bg color as well. Please fix. Free version doesnt have this issue. Also  instead of 5 different font sizes  make an option to enter exact percentage because 3rd option is too small and 4th is a bit too big. 120% is ideal imho.,4

Almost! Have to give it four stars because on my LG G Watch R the coin does not show up centered. It's up and to the left and a little bit of the coin is cut off. IF it was centered it would be perfect. I'm sure a fix will happen eventually  but you may want to take note developer and test it out. Also  another Android Wear issue is that when I have random selected it still sticks with the Minnesota coin and never changes to any of the other coins I have as options.,4

I would love to use it :-( [Update] You need to use the developers version to get it to work on Ubuntu 14.04  now to find out how to control it from Wear ;-) Use the developer PPA and upgrade  all is well (i needed a dist-upgrade before it installed),4
Very good Am option to choose background color would've been better!,4
Great app with alot of awesome customization! However notifications sometimes get stuck on one text and won't let you interact. This is kinda annoying. Also when hitting the home button it takes me to my launcher menu instead of my homepage. Great App tho and I still use it as my default app,4
Very good,4
Solid calendar App Simple and flexible widget to view multiple calendars at a glance. Wish you could adjust the color of each calendar though (versus auto-generated by the app),4
I use it all the time,4

Chromecast Connect Done Quickly! Very fast CC connect with one click after opening app instead of 3 or more with CC app. Main screen could feature better design and it needs a Disconnect one click exit too. Miracast isn't working with WDTV and Sony Experia  but Miracast is hit and miss with other widgets. It's a keeper  simplify the disconnect button and make main screen like main Chromecast screen and you have a faster  better CC app than the official one!,4
Works well for me  but... Please add a SEARCH feature in the BLOG POSTS section. It's so hard to find old posts to edit...,4
Just good enough,4
"Physical location It will be great if this app superimposes user's physical location on images. It will be a good value add. The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Wind Direction"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tab shows the wind in opposite direction in graphic. Needs correction.""""",4
Good Good app. The only thing is that I could do something one day and then not know how to do it the next. Sometimes the features can be confusing and hard to work with.,4
great app would be nice if could download all the files at once in a given torrent except just one,4
Nice versatile App.... I spent a lot of time searching for such app and at last found this app. Its really awesome....,4

Better but Better than the native android app but still uses the native white balancing approach so the colors you get in the picture may not match the colors you actually see. Also  no option to turn off the click.,4

Mr Sukhbir,4
Great emulator Once you know how to get it working it's a great emulator with no lag. Wish I could connect it with the moga pocket because the on screen analogue stick is a bit tricky to use and certain textures/shadows aren't appearing (making some games a little harder than they should be)  I also wish it wouldn't close the rom if I switch apps breifly. Other than that  I love this app and it's one of the best emulators on android.,4
I like it,4
Amazingly delightfull,4
I like the app overall  however it is a lot harder to edit pages/create pages.,4
Good Use for Indian apk,4

Great and easy but where is the kitchen sink? I like my text to be aligned as justify and there are no text alignment options I can see. I can't publish posts from my phone without having to go on desktop and justify text first. It's a pain. As is uploading images to a post. But for rough drafts  this thing has changed the way I blog. Please fix missing features or just direct me to them if I've missed them! Thanks! **EDIT** Thank you for responding. Of course! I should have thought of that. It's not as easy as the kitchen sink but it'll do!,4
Is development dead?,4
Not bad,4
Sweety This apps make me happy,4

Donate recognized! 👌 Hmm .. looks like has been recognized again by the application. Okay  give a five 🌟 again for it. Thanks 4 u'r cooperation.,4
Very good app with a lot of functions and great usability. Even in Vietnam  Cambodia and Thailand is the accuracy of maps absolutely satisfying. My only complain is the search function. My hit rate in finding specific places  like temples  waterfall  parks and so on  is maybe 10%. Often even if I type the name exactly how it is labeled on the map. Therefore only 4 Stars.,4

Was a excellent almost flawless app This was working quite good till a few versions earlier. But now with the new updates I am facing a few problems. First of all with 60/60 billing mode it is considering a call which was not even picked up as a 60 sec call and adding it to the widget statistics. Secondly  it sometimes stops working  like it doesn't update the call and sms statistics. It again becomes active after the end of the billing period. Please look into this and give me a solution. I really loved this helpful app.,4
Average,4
It's working accept... The few issues I have noticed are that sometimes when viewing a .mp4 file it says incorrect data in the middle of the video and screen orientation is backwards aka if I want the picture in landscape I have to turn to portrait.,4
Useful for rooted devices The best and very useful apps.,4
awesome!,4
Nice I liked it,4
Nice,4
Works as intended  could be even better though. Works perfectly as intended. Only caveat is your contact has to be spelled exactly like it is on FB. If your friends have some weird names it won't work for that contact. Would be nice if you could manually sync certain people. Also syncing D.O.B. would be a nice addition.,4

Great UPDATE: after a couple of recent updates  SHIFT key has a problem within some apps; i.e. Terminal Emulator  which remains sticky and needs to get tapped several times to get to normal (reproduceable whenever switching between CAPS and smalls). Thanks for this great ASK! Using it since 2010. It is my first choice. Although it should be updated with new features and themes. Sony XPERIA Z,4

Good app to chat,4
Great overall  just wish there was an option to disable pinch-zooming and/or lock the existing zoom configuration. It's currently far too easy to accidentally zoom. Still  a great app.,4
Missing feature Where did the long press to copy password go?,4
Analysis menu not working Pressing and holding analysis menu does not open it. Please fix this bug.,4
So far this app is mostly expectations. Good selection of puzzles some more difficult than others. Navigation takes a bit of getting used to. My only criticism is with the nyt puzzle. Took off a star due to the nyt puzzle being the same on every week. Just take it off it's not going to work. Don't say it's part of the app when it's not really. On the upside I can do it really fast now!,4
could have better editing options. nearly impossible to crop with this app. except that the app is great,4

Looks great Tried this app to connect to music box for raspberry pi (linked to Spotify) as I wasn't to keen on their web interface. It works pretty well but it won't load songs lists for any album. It can play any of my predefined playlists though. If it could do this it would definitely be 5 star. Good work looks great.,4
I like it I just like it,4

Lot's of improvement available In order to compete with Whatsapp  ⑴ make archiving conversations available so that I can make my conversation page tidier. ⑵ Let us know who read our messages in groups!

Excelente Por favor pueden ponerle un pin o un lock pattern porque genera desconfianza tener el celular sin un código de bloqueo  de resto la aplicación es genial,4
Increased battery drain and not able to change lockscreen I have been using this for a few versions of the app and while I'm really digging it it's started to really drain the battery and destroy ram. I would keep using it if I could but with the phoje I have the extra battery drain isn't worth it. Apart from that  this is a really excellent app that I will definitely come back to with successive phones.,4
Good,4
Nice Really help a lot,4
good good foruse with matrix homeserver. BUT why cannot I found the button for answer video call on android client...？？？？ call can only answered on web client...,4
Good working easily,4
This app works but it could do better with more tweaks. Ive recently played Project Justice sadly the touch screen buttons are not working as it should  although the frame rate is good gameplay is ruined by the controls I hope there will be a fix for it. And Great Job with your app!,4
Golla Lucky,4
Great App but Dude I love the app  I've been using it for the past 6 months as my daily lock screen but recently I got a phone with a fingerprint scanner. Please add a feature for the fingerprint scanner I don't like using the regular lock screen and would like to use ac display instead.,4
Well done Great work on this. Great to see 1.0 coming to desktop. I was still hoping to see the ability to send multiple files from my phone to the kde box at once instead of one at a time. Other than that great work and thank you.,4
Gud,4
Same old classic I really like this app  and I use it all the time. My one complaint is that the NYT Classic puzzles are always the same. I get two. Over and over again. Otherwise  great app.,4
AYIENDA,4
It is an excellent application made by a very competent developer. On the other hand  the journal should be available in the basic version because it's very important to know if applications pass through the firewall. Yes  I am aware that paid options allow the developer to support its work  but advertising is already a good bet revenues. We are advertising without the benefits.,4
Cool but some apps need to be paid,4
Nice,4
Simplicity at its best....... However  the ability to add atleast a clock widget would have been very helpful. Nonetheless  this is the simplest any launcher can get. Great job 👍👍👍,4

Addictive Live the game. Not very good at it but im addictive. Would like to see a shop within the game to buy and sell equipment and stuff,4
Great idea implemented in beautiful app This application is even must have. It is very helpful for me to not have the same wallpaper every time if I will not change it with my hands. I only have one kind ask to developer  to add wallpaper left/right scrolling ability when changind desktop pages.,4
Nice feature  but needs a lot of improvements Please include the ability to update images of select contacts  and a backup option to save the earlier user image automatically  and revert to it in case. Options to change the font weight would also be welcomed.,4
Fine,4
Can't download this using N7 tecno android phone,4
One minor complain. On Android I don't see an option to discard the local changes(from the app) made to the blog post.,4
New user I just downloaded the app so I don't know how I am going to like the app yet. I feel like I'm gonna really like the app that's why I gave it 4 stars.,4
Fantastic,4
Nice to use Useful app..helps in rainy season by telling the cloud location .. On further time wise weather info will be much useful,4

It was originally a u.s.navy program Old military teck now available for civilians. Of course it is slow but is your security worth it. An idea for a Tor upgrade.will you please ad a option so that when Tor is down all network traffic does too.,4
Good performance nd good feature,4
Thank you very much for this software .,4
It's just nice.,4
New features It's great but it could use some new features like a widget to have a quick look at the status of torrent or being able to exit or restart vuze app on PC or be able to start Vuze App on PC when it is not running. And it could also use some updates to the UI to make it look better.,4
Superb Because it is our country app,4
Good No ads works and loads very fast,4
Very rich in detailed maps but the way to enter searched addresses drives me mad. That's why 4 instead of 5 stars.,4

You are the popular emulator in psp Pls add bluetooth and wifi in gold edition and beta in free,4
Nice but needs improvement Pretty much functional in all aspects of audio trimming though I ought to think additional sound editing should be added to make this app even greater  like fading out the sound towards the end. A little improvement in user interface and icon design are important too  better if the app will follow Material design standards to make it more appealing.,4
Very effective,4
Googler on Nice,4
Works great ...but would REALLY like to be able to change the order of the accounts on the authenticator screen.,4
Great crossword puzzle game. The best. However the most recent version has been erratic in showing and saving puzzle progress. Completed a puzzle and it did not show the completion dialog or save the solution. Some others stuck at percentages and did not update when completed.,4

Good But would be even better  if an app had the ability to rearrange and sort accounts.,4
Kool app Useful apk,4
Simply useful everyday Can you add option to show tasks also in the widget? It helped me to track my events  still left out about my tasks. Consider this for your next update.,4
The best keyboard I know. ASK is the coolest keyboard I've ever used. And it gets better. But one thing I don't like is keyboard sound. So  please change it. Water sound isn't a good one. And I kind of like Material Dark theme like that one that Google Pinyin Input has. So  if it's possible please add material dark/light themes. One last thing is it needs to add more emoji smileys. For instance  it has no flags and you'll need to add. Thank you.,4
Works Motorola g4 plus and rtlsdr,4
Beautiful A always want an app like this,4
Timaunghtay I love you tube,4
OK Laka,4
Great App I really like how it keeps my wallpapers fresh. However  the parallax effect is waaay too strong. I have two pages on my home screen and it skips right over the content of the image most times. If there was a slider for modifying the amount the image moves on scrolling between pages that would be swell.,4
Very use full,4
This app runs great. It works flawlessly on my Nextbook Ares 8. I can play Mario Kart DS with no lag. If you want it to work great  then do not run it on a low spec device. Otherwise don't complain about lag and problems. That is to be expected on a low performance tablet. I see to many complaints about that. It's common sense  if want it to work great then buy a tablet that is more than a paperweight.,4

Good Much better from other sd apps i used but the only thing is you cannot move back again movies back to your phone.cant find any how too,4
It works well and I'm learning but doesn't seem to display the third tone in pinyin correctly. Also you should be able to scroll at the left and use the whiteboard on the right. This will make it easier to practice writing while checking notes.,4
Great I had this app on my old phone and searched for it bc it was the best one of the bunch. I really dig this game,4
Good for everyone,4

Great but could be even improved more Finally we could enjoy pip videos system wide  this time you've made Android great again guys but you could even make Telegram greater by allowing us to watch native Telegram videos pip also I think two major features are missing: the first one is the ability to get muted notifications from chats (that button is called mute not kill)  the second one is the ability to choose how much to keep different types of cashe  for example choose to keep photos for one week and videos for one moth etc..,4

Stupid good emu but some games still Update: after the newwst update it kicks back out to home. Kudos to you developers...this is one amazing emulator. Sound emulation and game speeds are on point. Some games I do see have a problem and would love to fix for them....third strike in particular where the rendering is funky still...otherwise it's legit. Can't wait for more updates update: I don't know of its my note 4 but some games work some dont. The emulator is still great but disappointed some of my favorites don't work.,4
Much better,4

loving so amazing.,4
Freezes Good but sometimes freezes when u open app unable to open app at all now may delete it !,4
Ok,4
Lots of potential  they have a beta feature that adds approach waypoints to the flight plan (which will be very nice). The flight planning section is not as user-friendly or intuitive as other apps  but after taking additional time and working with the app  I give it 4 stars. I expect it will get better.,4
Great app,4
Pretty good now! They finally (finally!) brought back the dark theme and added an option to reorder your codes  so the app is quite nice now. The fonts and timer are still inexplicably small compared to the past  but that's no deal-breaker. What it does still need is import/export though. But overall Google continues to lead the way on 2-factor authentication.,4
Very good The app works very well and it gives my phone a fancy looking round screen. However  when I set the corners not to overlap the status bar  it looks kinda weird when the status bar doesn't have a solid black color  sometimes it imitates the main color of some apps (like red on YouTube or green on LINE). But overall  this is a very cool app  definitely worth to try.,4
Great  but is it possible to not change to landscape just to scan  or auto orientation depends on phone orientation?. Cause using app in portrait  but everytime barcode scanner is called it will change to landscape which is really not comfortable to use. Other barcode works fine in portrait.,4
Flexible Background App Enjoy the rotating carousel of memorable art  or use the Muzei App to choose various alternative image sources. If Art is your passion  contribute images. The UI could be more intuitive  but once you figure out how to navigate the features (image source  blur  and dim)  you'll realize that there is little to learn. This App's daily rotation of art has been my mobile background since the initial installation.,4
I wish Native Clipboard and Clip Stack could have a baby together to become the best clipboard manager as they both have advantages over the other.,4
Download its pretty good But it doesnt have MY EMO MUSIC,4
Great apps  only one things that need to improve is the lockscreen  it's kinda unstable to me,4
Great app but share bookmarks not working Scans most barcodes and has ability to share contacts and text. Share bookmarks doesn't work for me on a Nexus 5. Tapping bookmarks button but doesn't do anything.,4
It's work Tqsm bcoz this apps really fix wifi problem...,4
Useful Informative,4
I love this  does need a fix for android 5.0 / Nexus 5... I love this app and it does a great job. I recommend it. That said  There is a problem with latest Android and versions. I recently upgrade my nexus 5 to Android 5.0 (Lillipop) and I cannot enter space bar when trying to put comments in in this app (only in this app) so I can only comment using voice input. Would like to see that fixed soon. Behavior is this: I can type characters in comment field on a post  but when I hit space  no space is added. There is no way to type a space in the comment. This behavior is only on tinfoil app. No keyboard issues anywhere else in any other apps  etc.,4
Lollypop issues It is not being displayed in lock screen in lollypop. No issues in daydream mode.,4

Great Does what it says and work well.,4
Great app with one flaw App works great except when you receive SMS from eg. your provider (the one that you cant reply)  then it will crash if I tap on icon (try to open contact details). Another issue is that you cant block that either (it dissapears  but on next app opening it shows up again).,4

Perfect for what I am looking for. A password generator that uses NO PERMISSIONS and doesn't send any content anywhere. The only gotcha is that the default font (for my phone?) make it hard to tell the lowercase l from a capital I (IlIlIlIl) :) Would like to be able to change it. I don't normally have to type the password (copy/paste normally) but occasonally i use it to generate passwords for apps off-phone. (workaround: switch to landscape mode...the font changes to a serif font that makes it clear what's going on).,4

5 stars  till the newest update. Where are the jonesin' puzzles?! They are my favorite  but looks like they aren't available to download anymore. There are plenty of good puzzles besides  but I got this app just so I could play those puzzles!,4
It's great and all but some games are just black screens,4
This is the excellent flash card so far that I have experienced. Previously I used Brainscape on iOS  but it lack of customization features comparing to Anky (and AnkiDroid). With this app  you are able to store and back up multimedia decks externally  and even share with others. That is above my expectations. I wish I know this app earlier. The second feature I like and use frequently is the playback  it makes much easy to review what have been learned. There is still room for improvements  for example  users can choose different algorithms/ways to select a card for studying/reviewing  randomly card selection is an option. The reason is that for big decks  too much repetition for some cards makes the learner tired and wastes time. That is a reason I dropped one star.,4
I think it is cool because with this updated you can play more games with this app🐱,4

Great App But With Some Problems I enjoyed playing many adventure games using this app. It feels great! However  this app has some problems. Beneath A Steel Sky's mouse pointer is black instead of white and the menu (which it has a speed adjustment which requires to get a certain item in LINC) doesn't show up when I hit the back button. Then  Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror's cutscenes are often choppy. EDIT: I downloaded BS2's DXA's cutscenes on ScummVM's website and they run smoothly.,4

Great app Love the app helps me fall asleep when I am hyped up at the end of a long day. Is there any way to set a timer so that the lucid dream beats would come on after I'm already asleep? If so I would happily rate this 5 stars!,4
Best,4
Its really easy to use thx for making this wonderful app,4

How to update this version.,4
Good one Cool stuff liked it,4
Formidable,4
Its good,4
Great app It's useful and has no ads the only problem is you have to toggle settings to change between 2.4g and 5g other than that this is useful especially for big houses,4
Needs a custom url or search Facebook feature It needs a way to paste Facebook links that I can only find via Google into it. Or failing that  a way to load tinfoil if you click a fb link in your browser or other app.,4
It blocks users based on any report without telling the reason.,4
Separate Make it all in one. Of course PDF and a library are necessities just make them into one app,4
Just love it. Wish the interface (UI) can be modernized a little.,4
Wow,4
Best email app Poor 5.201 update  let me disable the confirmation to mark all mail as read  please take the training wheels off the bike! When you add a feature take a look at how other features are integrated and match it. This provides a much more predictable ui. Similar features should provide similar options. Reverting to previous build. May the requestor for this feature forever be bombarded with pop ups to confirm every action ;-) ps would appreciate zoom back.,4
ok Good,4

Does what it's supposed to do!,4
Best game ever!!! I feel like this game brings a whole new feeling behind it. I can not define the amazing clutches I've made or the reasonable deaths I've had. But most of all I think that this game would me more fun if there was a Bluetooth connection with friends. My mates would always like to contest whom will live the longest  however I believe this game will be more fun surviving with others.,4
Nice job so far But saving the 5th star for when its a little more stable. ************************************** Update 3/18/17 update seems much more stable... great file manager goodbye to ES ...... thank you.,4
Everything I need  but The reminders are not working. The habits are set to be repeated everyday and reminder at any day of the week. But it doesn't work. As the number of habits I add is becoming large  I would like this feature to work. Given this  great app. A one stop solution. Thank you.,4
Alright App,4

Difficult but enjoyable. Addictive but it got static when I couldn't beat the first of at least three bosses after multiple hundred runs.,4

Nexus 6 This is an excellent app  but the Nexus 6 needs to be added. PSD's for the device have been available for a while  so I'm not sure why there's such a delay in getting a frame into this app.,4

Good Information is good...,4
I like this app. But it loads kinda slow after I close the app. It took a few minutes to show the new message(s) up after I openned it  or I have to entered the chat room so the message(s) show up and there was no sign mark where the new message started from.,4
Very good app Nice app  but  on Android 5.1.1 sometimes works  sometimes doesn't...pls fix,4
Super,4
Like it...,4
Coo It would be better if inthad free calling,4
Thanks for all,4
I know! I think they messed up big time. But your apps can still save to SD you just can't edit  rename  cut  copy or paste. ~ Camera is great. I wish it could let you send to a different path/folder where you can save. I like to have my photos and videos stored on the SD card instead of the phone's memory. Other than that it's a decent little camera for those quickie shots.,4
Who really Cares I dont really care,4
Love it. Love it but  the saved drawing can not be seen. It was blank. I love the autodesk sketchbook too but after their updates I can't install it to my phone. Please make the old version of it back so I can use it to my phone.,4

One question I have  how to open new tab? It seems I can open one tab at a time,4
App.is beautifully designed  but is missing some features. Access to network resources and 3rd party cloud services like MEGA would be nice.,4
Love it. After failing to find out where all my space was going  downloaded this app. That was 4 minutes ago. Problem now solved. Wish someone had thought of this for Windows back in the day when hard drives were smaller.,4
Concept Very good idea and concept.,4
Fantastic App .,4

Easy to use,4
good app but why new version is not available?,4
No longer ad free. Adding ads not my idea of an update.,4
Much room for additions The Design and interface feels exceedingly fluid but the app lacks many features. Consider adding features like System Analyser  gesture navigaton  tagging  favourites  FTP manager  trash  swipe for options etc.,4
Blogging in the palm of your smartphone! I registered from the web. And now i can manage my blog from this app so easily. Editing comments solved i hope u can make more simple editing comment integration on notification tabs just click on visitor comment gravatar n the editing option will pop up (such that) is way more eficient n simple :-) thx!,4

Nice one,4
Outstanding but with issues. Telegram is my favorite messaging app. Besides bots  which is something that needs to mature still. Telegram has the the best features of all messaging apps. Unfortunately  I always have issues with notifications. Half the time i don't get notified and i only realize there's a new message when i open the app. The contacts list has syncing issues also. Been like this for like a year now.,4
Good apps,4
Im playing the sims 2 castaway stories it keeps freezing because of maybe too much objects. Can u fix this problem? Or is there a problem with the PPSSPP app? Also the harvestmoon boy & girl i cant play because of black screen ..,4

"1 important feauture Just installed this morning. So far its been pretty helpful  it'd be awesome if there were a little question mark next to the labels.

If I could click a little ? Symbol to see what each settings definition or its use   that would be awesome. That would get you my 5 star rating  I would even donate. Please add this feature (: would save me a lot of time because as of right now I'm googling a bunch of definitions....""""",4

Good app. 5 to 6 puzzles a day and you can go back 10ish days as well. Works offline  only using Internet to download new puzzles. Interface. Can be clunky at times but not distracting.,4
very thorough I've been using this for a while despite owning PDFs to most of the books. I mostly use this app for the bookmarking feature so I can easily call up skills and descriptions for my characters. I also like that I can filter what rule books are used. What would be awesome and make this a 5* app for me is the ability to sync bookmarks between devices.,4
Nice,4

Lovely apps,4
I like it but i seem to experience some type of bug or something. When i recieve a text notification  when my phone is set to silent  it constantly turns on and off the screen until i check or dismiss the notification. Is it the texting app i use? Is it something in the settings that i need to check or uncheck? Or is it simply a bug? would really appreciate a responses. My battery sometimes drains because of this problem... I use a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active.,4

Its nice but But i cant seem to play sd gundam g generation overworld without it crashing frequently. G generation portable works just fine.

Good but not updated after require,4
one suggestion  please make a widget that shows summary of all the habits instead of having to choose only one habit to show on my phone's home page. I need a brief veiw by not having to click into to app and see. Other that  this app is perfect. Thank you so much.,4
Very nice app It is a application software which help blind people to use android mobile phone.l got 5 star but I am not blind.thank you.,4
Almost there! I like this app  but there's one key feature that the competition beats then out on. Ability to have more than one device with the same setup. With Authy I can use the same 2 factor setup on all the same accounts  but I can also use it on my tablet and desktop. No fumbling for my phone while I'm logging in from my other devices.,4

Awesome app  gyro not good I loved this app! However  I noticed after recent updates (either app or Android system  not sure which) that the map is less accurate and very jumpy! I've used this app for awhile and loved it  but when I went to look for the recent meteor shower  it took me awhile to get it working  and it is still not steady and not very accurate. I am judging accuracy based on the moon's location  which is big and bright  but not write correct on the sky map! Please fix this  and I would give 5 stars!,4

Best program ever! Does all its work in the background. Never bothers you and it's indispensable! But now I unfortunately hesitantly need to. Take away the five star rating. When restoring sms an option should be given to how many or which sms to restore. Most people have tens of thousands of sms saved. It's takes for ever to restore them all and most people won't need all. Keep up the good work!,4

Withholding that last star for collection editing. :) The app makes reading forums and seeing my collection very phone friendly. I would like to be able to add to and edit my collection though. Also  please don't show me the timeout error message until I request more information. Just because I'm not currently getting internet access  there is no reason that I shouldn't be able to finish reading what I've already downloaded. New Internet button in the forums is handy!,4

Droidfish is not complete without those missing functions... So please listen and implement those must have features as soon as possible... I'm really getting annoyed now... I think I'm helping Droidfish to be fully developed but u r taking it negatively. Don't misjudge me Peter...OK looks like every good suggestion is worthless. Never seen such a dumb developer...,4

Settings are very limited. Would love to see a data save feature of some sort and maybe some extra options like the clearing of cookies and history on exit. Other than that it's a very clean app that allows you to use orbot without a hitch.,4
Good enough Works fine  but the switch between the main menu horizontal interface and the vertical file chooser one is definitely NOT a plus!,4
No support for hyper links in a document. Have been using OpenDocument Reader on my Samsung Tab 3 Lite for several months. It did the trick for reading documents that I have created and posted in Dropbox for all platforms. However  recently I created (with Open Office) and posted a document containing hyper link buttons. The document works fine on a laptop opened with Open Office (waiting for feedback from users using other platforms) but ODR apparently does not provide support to hyper link.,4

This app is everything I was looking for  with one exception: I cannot successfully add already-catalogued books to bookshelves. I'm sure it's easy to do once you know how  but the FAQs does not cover it and there are no instructions. Perhaps you are supposed to add books directly to the desired bookshelf? If so  is there a way to move a book to a different shelf if you change your mind later? This app is still great  I'd change rating to 5 stars once clarification is provided.,4
Simple and efficient. Simple  no frills  efficient.,4

Nice Good,4
Icons are not set How can i set (or change) the icons for the entry (not groups)?,4
I like it All its missing is a color chooser in the wear app and the same functionality in the form of a widget then this will be the only lighting controller we would need since it would have it all  compared to competing apps,4
It's pretty good just a Lil later with new music,4
Great app  ugly as sin.,4
Impress Vell,4
This is a good app. But when voice and video call function will come.,4
Ok fine,4
Love it but Would give anything to be able to change font size in the expanded widget view. Font is way too big.,4
Yes Good working,4
Good,4
Loved it till this update  now just like it! I loved seeing the CPU usage of each core on my HTC One S  after this update I see only one bar instead of two. I would love to be able to enable permanent usage view for both cores  or revert to the previous version I used on my phone. Great app  love the usage view off all 4 cores on my Nexus 7 Gen.1! EDIT: The CPU usage view bar seems to change dynamically now  not sure whether I like it though.,4
Good app for what's there  wish I didn't have to install a 3rd-party barcode scanner though - a built-in scanner in Android would be much better. Would also like to see fingerprint authentication before being able to view the codes.,4
good,4
Nyc,4
Ok Good,4
Go,4
Excellent App  but one sore point This works great and is really elegant. The devs obviously put in a lot of time  but sometimes the widget doesn't refresh. If there was a configurable option to refresh the app every X minutes  that would be great!,4
"Good app but resets to since """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""boot"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" when I restart my phone and I want it at always since """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""unplugged""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""",4
Best easy to use Nice simply and gud,4
its hot its too good,4
Superb,4
It's very good,4
Loved it. Started using this for my venture into blogging and really liked it. You need to give some time to understand how how to get around. But there are free courses on it to help you get to the speed,4
Pretty good Either there is no search function like in iOS  or its too hard to find. Other than that it is a really good app.,4
Usefull,4
I hope it can have a feature where you can report a person as a spammer or someone who you don't like to see their posts or hide their posts or something.,4
Hunter I love this app because its so useful,4
Nice,4

Works Sometimes hard to stop it tracking  but it does the job well. I use it for surveys on foot  bicycle  and bus. It's easy to use  and easy to upload the data to OSM and to export the data for other applications.,4
Love the developers. Thanks for such a unique app....,4
Good App Please Change The App Icon!!!! Plsss,4

Problem is just the calls that there is delay for transfer and receiving voice in calls,4
It works Haven't used any other .epub reader so can't do a comparison but I haven't had any problems with it. I mostly use it on .epub and occasionally .txt,4
awesome,4
Fade in volume Still the best  free alarm clock. Unfortunately the latest update reduced fade in time to 60 sec max. Too short in my opinion.,4

Great app but need improvement Not compatible with cm13 on my oneplus one. After granted root permission  amaze recognizes /data and some other directories as file and cannot enter them  while ES works without any problem. please fix. I'd like to provide further information.,4
App It's an app that will not update on my phone...it acts like its downloading but after 2 days it's still not done. Unless it's the biggest download ever I think Google goggled this one up...fix it bitches!!!!!! Please and thank you. Don't make me go to my Uncle Willie Gates....,4

Perfect App for Reminders Loving the App so far ..the Nagging Reminder is a brilliant feature .. The only thing missing is a widget ...just something to keep a tab on your reminders ..would be great if that could be implemented in future ..,4
Love it. But stats no longer provided when puzzle completed. Also when all boxes have been filled completion percentage reads 99%max. A little annoying.,4
All thats missing its the weapon skill checklist,4

Apparently fixed for 6.0.1  thanks! In search it doesn't take words  but string. Trailing space is significant so after picking word in type  must backspace. Can't compose or paste formatted text. Can attach pics  but not paste...,4
Only notifications problem ... I am not getting the notification please fix this issue,4
Better than stock Trying it out,4
Its good but... Its a good emulator but when i play my pokemon games  nds4droid will crash sometimes while playing. I hope you fixed it :),4
Great game and actually challenging AI. Would be 5stars if I could play friends in person or find them online.,4
It's good apps Working on my phone....thanks,4
Probably an abandoned app. When you customise it  it looks really good.,4
veri good,4
Awesome,4
Open source File Manager So far so good. No ads or bloatware. Clean UX and easy on the eye UI.,4
You people be fast,4
Nice Does what it says for reading odt docs and has an edit ability to. The occasional doc seems to be outside the edges of the readable screen?  perhaps needs a bit of work there.,4
Best I've used Great player! Caveat: Skipping through a cast sometimes causes the player to stick and not play. You can skip again and usually it continues normally.,4
Excellent! but  few suggestions I like this Concept and simple UI. But  there is no hourly tracking and it will not work in background  no notifications after I close this app. Thank you (y),4
This is good,4
Solid Auto fill the library when I add things. +2x playback speed. Minimal. Thanks,4
Ok I got 2 issues. 1) i couldn't add alias name to my apps.2) music files are not opening using track. Apart from these   app is working fine for me. Thank you.,4

Cool but... On my moto g4 plus while going back to all albums it hangs a while,4
Most Excellent - but some issues NetGuard is by far the best no-root firewall for Android that I have found. I like the UI and especially appreciate the screen-on controls. I think the all-pro price is reasonable and I was happy to pay it.  I wish I could give it 5 stars  but I can't.  I have encountered several minor and significant problems. I'm compiling a list to submit to the author. Adding simultaneous firewall and VPN capability would be uniquely valuable.,4
Nice Nice,4
Helps with downloading eveything I want to load...,4
Amazing piece of software! I do  however  wish there was an option to keep the screen awake. The wakelock option in the notification shade seems to only stop the app from being closed/slept by Android  rather than it being a screen wakelock. I've been able to work around this by making a tasker task to detect when Termux is open then adjusting the screen timeout accordingly  but it's a bit hit-or-miss. Something built in would probably work better.,4

Good enough This app lacks one thing: an ability to set up notifications for delays. Every so often the system has a problem and it would be nice to be told about them rather than open the app to find out. Other than that it's great.,4
Informative,4
Nice,4
Best option for Moto Display functionality This is the best option for those looking for Moto Display for non-moto devices. I'd gladly give 5 stars as I'm sure a lot of hard work goes into this app  but functionality seems diminished by my finger print security requirements. If I want to use Nexus Imprint then I am required to use a lock screen that employs added security PIN or pattern. Sometimes I'll unlock via the finger print scanner and it will open  but sometimes it'll only open to other lock screen and require my pattern to open. Thanks!,4

I have been using this lightweight app for a while now. It does what it claims and it does so well. A couple of quirks to note: seemingly would not detect Google Play Music though scrobbles this correctly under the 'Android Music Player' despite saying it's not installed. I sometimes get duplicate scrobbles of the same track if I leave the player paused for long periods of time. Keep up the good work!,4
Pretty straightforward. Only thing it needs is to support hidden files and folders like the web client does.,4
Great app  much improved The app previously crashed uncontrollably on the Nexus 10. It works much better now  and the addition of FORM watch face support makes it even better. Glad to see it finally works as expected.,4

I like your app but there are two issues First: I use facebook messenger's chat heads  when I unlock the phone the messenger chat head bubbles spoils the clean-ish look.. Is there a way to hide it on AcDisplay? Also it provides a bit of insecurity as anyone could just wake my phone and see incoming messeges (I use the lockscreen option)| Second: Why should your app take too much ram so it surely uses the CPU in the background taking up battery.. or am I wrong?,4

Good but Good. I have only used it for a short time so far and I am already impressed with how it looks and performs. It took just a few seconds to find my server and music with no input from me.

Simple & Effective This app is simple to use  extremely good looking (adhere to material design)  especially appearance settings are so easy to use. Does lack some high level customisation offered in other apps but not to worry as not used often. Icon needs some work as it should depict something on sms. QK compose is a superb feature who do lots of sms. Blocking & blacklisting needs development as not much effective. Best part is it doesn't have any ADS,4
Great but didn't solve my problem; yet? Could you add feature to favorite sites so I'd get IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes on top when I search a TV/Film title? Showing scores and number of votes on search page would also help. Thanks for consideration!,4

Works as advertised It's a great app  even the option menu has a sleek design. I've been using this app on all of my devices. One thing I dislike though is that this app uses a lot of ram  if the developers could somehow manage to cut the ram usage in half I would be a very happy man.,4

So great just needs a widget Such a great app really like the design and layout. Keeps getting better a day better  I just can't drop Yatse for this until Kore gets proper widget support,4
Best Android keepass solution Great app  works as described. I only wish it were sexyier!,4

Great app BUT... Love this app  been using it for two years and it's a daily part of my life. However  the latest update now has it stopping or pausing all the time  what a let down.,4

Huh When i put in the c.o.c code it says it cannot access root server,4
Nice,4
Hi.I m using first time nice one.,4
One of the best apps that reveals the truth about factory app spying! I could pull my hair out trying to stop every pre installed app from spying on my phone  SMS  location  voice  actions ext. This no root app is a step in the right direction. We need to stop this invasion of privacy by Google and the powers that that be. Get the spy monitor app. It shows which apps are spying and who owns the app. Fight for your right to privacy.,4
nice ki,4
Very nice Good simple app. For me the best feature is the floating bubble - it floats I've everything  but you can adjust it's size and transparency so it's not intrusive. Suggest that a facility to separate clips into lists would be a good development.,4
How to download games How can i download games!!!!!,4
It is awesome and fun 4 stars cause of the quality and features. The remain one star will be given if can add the feature of changing wallpaper manually like triple tap the screen then will change next wallpaper instead of waiting.,4

A decent client A bit clunky but could really use a font with zero / Capital O differences. Very decent in day to day usage.,4
This is a good emulator but could there be cheats button on the emulator plz and a 2017 update,4
Last upgrade broke #mh namespace support I didn't see anything about namespace support in the changes for the last version  or I wouldn't have upgraded without testing  but I can no longer get at any of my mail. This won't affect very many people  but for those it does it's a complete showstopper. (My IMAP server is UW imapd.),4
Works for me And i would give it five stars IF it would work together with my online mobile karaoke apps like red karaoke and sing by smule.....maybe in some future upgrade?,4
Clean  simple and gets the job done. The app is overall really good  the only thing I wish it had is the ability to change the themes. Not a fan of the stock color scheme 😅,4
Fables Awesome,4

Can't download this using N7 tecno android phone,4
I switched when TextSecure dropped SMS encryption and have been happy with my choice. The encryption works almost transparently and there have been no dropped or delayed messages like TS push messages. Sometimes  if the SMS messages making up an encrypted payload arrive out of order  SMSSecure can't decrypt it. However  my biggest issue has been that on Republic Wireless  I can't send MMS group messages using SMSSecure. I'd like to convince my family to encrypt  but I can't expect them to deal with that.,4
Without dis app you tube will not run so it is good,4
I like the emojis  same as Iphone. Great app,4
Can't scan digital images  by accepting shares,4
4 stars. Crashed on Droid turbo 2 while trying to focus in on an object while recording in 4K,4
Starring mail... Good app. Has some minor issues that are interface design oriented. Not sure if this is an Android exclusive problem  but starring email from initial screen is a pain. Will scroll up email instead of starring. Not a deal breaker. Also searching for old mail is not very intuitive. Finding sent mail could be easier. I do like and use it every day. Will never replace Gmail.,4
Good,4
Good app.,4

Good app  request an additional feature... I wish the daydream mode would allow you to choose dim for night and day. In the day I want the clock brighter than when I'm trying to sleep. This would be a great feature and change my review to 5 stars. Other than this niggle it's an impressive app and much better than the standard daydream clock.,4
Great but Its a great app good amount of info but I'd like it if you guys would make the weaknesses with down arrows Aswell cause it looks like a gypceros has resistance to fire? Lol just a thought,4

Search function/indexing improved but can't delete search history. Downloaded the complete Wikipedia ZIM file (wikipedia_en_all_nopic.zim). The most recent update greatly improved search/indexing function. However  from 5 stars  I have to remove one star due to inability to delete search history. You have to go to 'settings - installed apps - kiwix - clear data' just to remove your or someone else's browsing/search history you don't want retained in your phone.,4
Very good work Loved this app but one problem i have another phone asus zenfone 5 while downloading it is showing not support your device please help,4

The app is ok however it doesn't have an option of deleting old messages in group chats. Kindly advice,4
It's nice  but lacks customization. I really only use this for the Daydream function  but it's pretty lacking in decent customization options.,4

Can you make this app run bat file??,4
Have been searching for a music file player that has all the checkmarks  FLAC  replaygain  shuffle  and VM seems to cover them all. Only hit for the lockscreen controls being virtually invisible to the point that they are unusable in the car  no matter what theme/setting I've tried. Kind of a dealbreaker for me  actually...otherwise a great piece of kit,4
Its decent  its not always reliable but it gets me somwhere,4
Its ite Download alot from this app full albums to,4

Very good. .but requires compatibility I like the app. But when a .docx file that is formatted in ms word with tabs  is opened in this app  alignments disappeared  the matter appeared in a mess.,4
GOOD app,4
Great player  one problem This is an awesome app  love it. But there's one problem. Everytime i unpause it through the earphones while the phone is locked it activates google voice control  something that doesn't happen when i use any other player.,4
Very good for stock phones Stock android does not show battery percentage.this one is best one with low memory usage.have to incrase the font size though...?,4

Best Free Tracker Free  ad-free  open  simple  effective  fast  with supports for imports from other habit trackers and exporting data in CSV. Only lacks a social component  which some people appreciate.,4
Worked perfectly Updated review: after getting a phone with Android nougat this app is no longer able to modify hosts entries. Old review: Works 100% as advertised and deserves a much higher rating. Some people are rating low because they don't know how to root their phone. That's not the apps fault. If you don't know what root is then you probably shouldn't have root access anyway.,4
Great app.,4

Please don't ever make it like WhatsApp!,4

Nice service,4
This app is very good. I have been using this app for close to two years. It isn't perfect but it is very good. The best on the market as far as I'm concerned. Definitely worth donating.,4
Analog stick input I do not see the analog stick inputs in settings. It should be there. Sonic Adventure 2 cannot be played without it and I am sure many other games can't either. I am definitely not going to use touch screen controls for it. Could you support the red samurai controller?,4
Better if city's temperature is added.,4
"By far best MAL app Great app  very useful. Only issue I have is the personal info page  it seems like sometimes it ignores the info I put in  even on the latest version. Maybe consider having a discrete """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""update info"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button at the bottom of the page? It would be useful  cause I'm not really sure when/if my change is getting saved to server.""""",4
Blast from the past Haven't found a Rom that hasn't worked yet and so far no crashes or lag. Only gripe is that its not purely point and click; you have to guide the mouse and THEN click  which can make some parts of some games (when you have to be quick) challenging. All in all  great Emulator,4
I love dis app Good,4
Simple and best.,4
For a new version,4
Usefull,4
Incredible App! All in one app Games  Send file  download etc,4
OI File Manager Its Good,4
Letgo of the clutter; Be free! We love this local shopper/seller's app! The only thing that could be improved would be that when duplicate or false profiles are discovered  they should be deleted straight away. Other than that  a solid 4 out of 5 🌟 stars!,4
Unable locate Packages I am able to run commands like apt install python  and it installs the package but it shows me error that it is unable to locate the package..,4
Awesome But... It makes my phone a little bit laggy while scrolling through my phone  if fixed then 5 stars all the way :D,4
Great Widget but... Really like the widget and features but thought I'd suggest a setting for selecting the desired view of the calendar when you tap on the widget. Thanks!,4
Killed off by google This was a brilliant app. Now google have updated webview and chrome the app cannot upload images directly. Hopefully it can be fixed. Loved this app.,4
Very Helpful With minimal improvements could easily be 5 stars,4
Need to see Tasks too I really like the interface and compatible with S Planner calendar nicely but it would be better if I can see tasks that are saved in S Planner too.,4

Very good reader This is a very good reader  it also has support for editing documents but for big documents it was very very slow for editing to the point that i would say it was unusable. I have a Nexus 5 phone so it is one of the top phone and it couldn't handle editing a document. This was as of 04/27/14 so they might be able to improve. But it does what is saids it will do that is read Libreoffive documents and it does it well,4
Fun app.,4
Good,4
"Great but few issues. Dark UI would be much appreciated for us amoled users. List load and refresh times are very slow for me and unfortunately when you rotate the device it attempts to refresh the list again which is painful. The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Delete all extracted APKs"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in settings needs a confirm popup - I just deleted everything with a finger slip. Otherwise it's a very promising app with a great visual layout and easy to navigate! Great job!""""",4

Please increase the area of widget.a lot of widget dont fit because of the square area.please increase the size of widget.overall its the best lockscreen.,4
Wonderful! App!,4
Works great Does what it says  changes wallpapers set to whatever time you want. Can have your own custom pics or grab the add ons. The reddit one is really easy to use. Just wish there was a way to set a fixed position for each pic and for this app to remember it. You can move it as it's set as your background  but as soon as it changes and comes back the app doesn't remember the last position.,4
Kidu Kkikkidu,4
A bit problem while downloading.,4
When will I receive the actual version of Google assistant in English (India) and not the beta version which makes me use English (USA),4
Great app. looks awesome. wish i didn't have to update the video library on the remote every time i update the Kodi library,4
Great! Just please add the option to ignore certain notifications within the same app  currently one can only either ignore the whole app altogether or receive all of its notifications  for example I want to be notified of new WhatsApp messages but that's it  I don't want it to voice notify me that I have copied a message or deleted so many messages  thanks,4
Good For SMS  Not For MMS I used this to move my SMS history from an old device to a new device. The SMS backup and restor went smoothly and perfectly. However  the MMS restore functionality isn't written yet  so no good there. I donated. Maybe the author can make it happen.,4
I just wanted to say hello to telegrams amazing team and thank you for the great app you created Theres a missing option about the privacy of the app that would be a dream for many users. we want the option to hide the message seen mark from the contact we choose  just like the last seen mark and that would help privacy a lot and help us more! sincerely An enthusiast telegram user,4

Still new to it Really intelligent design.,4

best lock screen but.. no security features  you have to use the phones own lockscreen which will require you to unlock the device twice. please consider adding even just pin and pattern  this will allow us to keep the phone private among friends even if it is not really secure(I read the faqs my phone does not allow pins only  it comes with the default lockscreen my phone will have 2 lockscreens when i enable it),4

Good for lite games. Fix issues for wwe 2k14,4
Almost perfect for me Do not be fooled. This is a very useful browser with many features that make browsing with your phone bearable. Fast  light yet renders as well as chrome and other heavier apps. My only gripe is the lack of zoom facility for some websites such as Facebook. Please add a force zoom facility. But thank you for all the effort that has gone into this.,4
Finger print support Please add nexus imprint support for 5x and 6p in Android M. It's a shame that this app don't have the support. This is one app which should have fingerprint support.,4

Great app! I suggest adding feature to track bad habits.. or things that occure few times a year for example.,4
Unintuitive to use,4
Its quite good,4
Please add a feature in which the size of emojis can be modified just as the size of the font can. Also  on group chats could there be some sort of thing that could let us know who read the messages? (Update: I'm so happy that Telegram calls have finally come  but could the sounds for like calling and ending the call be different? I mean it's just not really subtle for the ears and well I don't know if this is important or anything but personally I find it really annoying to hear but that's just me I guess. Also whenever you take a photo through Telegram  it always appears to be really sharp and edgy. Please fix.),4
This apps is so ease for use...,4
Goood,4
Great but messages freeze the app now Im against all the Facebook privacy issues so this app is beneficial. I've noticed that the messages haven't been working recently. Every time I open them  the app shuts down.,4
Very nice app,4
Loved it but like to have more options Option to select habit repetition days,4
best simple and safe,4
Good,4
Way better and everything is so simple,4
Great,4
Awesomly Awesome I enjoy making comics with this app  though it takes long to open. But i cant stop laughing at my own comics. Good job creators!,4
Awesome Like it,4
Very nicely made  set as my default. Star off for lack of light metering mode choices (see fv-5).,4
Good  but very American centric. It would be nice if we could get some UK  or Canadian sources so we don't have to know trivial details about US politics  show biz and life.,4
Lovely I love this app,4
Mr derek Good,4
Bien,4
Cool,4
Dab people,4
i use this a lot. i'd be happier if i could fix the mostly useless secondary character display on english keyboards. just have to look at other keyboards that do that bit right. NEW problem w/New version sticking around in memory and eating some cpu when not being used anymore. VERY annoying  and only expected from all the shady spying apps. this keyboard really needs more developers who can add more custom choices. i love the potential it has to nicely replace all other conventional keyboards,4
great app been using for the last 3 or 4 years  being a security app though shouldn't we be seeing regular updates just to keep things secure and maybe fingerprint sign in would be a nice option to save typing pw all the time  I think this app is a great little number but I've only ever had 1 or 2  at the most updates.,4
Great app... with a couple of issues Great app  though there are some things that I wish were different. I wish it worked in the Google Launcher on KitKat and Lollipop. I wish it worked consistently on Lollipop (the rounded corners come and go seemingly randomly). I realize that it can't be applied to the status bar  but if it at least worked on the bottom corners I think the GEL would look better. Also if the rounding could be applied to popup boxes  such as the app drawer  that would be a great enhancement. Overall 4/5 stars!,4
Skies of Arcadia Only reason I (and anyone else) want(s) a dreamcast emulator and it works! Mostly... First of all REICAST CAN ONLY PLAY .GDI FILES. If you can't get a game to launch  make sure it's the right file type don't blame the app. Secondly  when playing the screen flickers. Its only during cutscenes and like once every minute so its fine but I'd rather it not be there... Graphics are better than they were on Dreamcast. Gonna love having this app. Thanks guys.,4
Please do a bit more on UI.,4
Cant,4
Shouldn't need to exist... ...but glad it does. Works with a Synology NAS to enable calendar and contact sync.,4
Great App Great app for binaural beats. The only issue I have is that it keeps stopping when using other apps. Please improve functioning in the background and I will give a 5 star:-).,4
Suites perfect mobile e-mail management needs.,4
Fineapps,4
Would love it if it didn't constantly run and detain my battery. All in all however great app!!,4
Decent The UI is a bit awkward and I wish it could use the graphs directly from the Developer Console instead of generating it's own over time. But overall it's a good tool to have when I want to reply to reviews or look at statistics without having to load up the full website on my device.,4
One Annoying Bug I really love this app! Easy to use! Except it doesn't load some of the songs correctly. It'll only load maybe the first fifteen seconds of some but all of others. Please fix and I'll give 5 stars!,4
Sometimes crashes but great On my rooted note sometimes gets disabled automatically but is otherwise a good app,4

Bug I can't update youtube and gmail after I update my phone to lollipop and i cant update google play service error code 506,4

Awesome! By far my favorite app. Kudos to the devs. It works well. I only gave 4 stars because of a graphical glitch on the right hand side of screen. It doesn't affect gameplay at all.,4
Nice I'd like to give it 5 stars  but lot of widget not shown in the home screen. And 1 question  is it possible to make the apps icon looks smaller?,4
Excellent. Very useful,4

Pretty good I would like to see categories included. I would like to see a multi day reminder feature. Finally I'd like to see multiple types of data other than a yes or no. Otherwise I prefer this app over anyother currently since its free  no ads  and no inapp purchases/service fee,4

Gvraja Nice app,4
Not working 7.1.1 nexus 6p. Please make it work again.,4
Almost perfect! I love this app  it does what it says it will and it looks amazing. The only problem I have noticed so far is the app bugs and doesn't appear when you clear your notifications on the lock screen  but not in the notification panel. Other than that it is awesome.,4
It d eight Wonder of the world It faster n reliable working with am happy it existing,4
The Boss Great app,4
A few bugs This app was amazing overall  but there were a few annoying bugs that I faced. First  the rectangles where the auto complete text options are located in do not change length to accommodate the length of the text. Second  when I type listen followed by a space the app crashes. Also  some commands aren't supported like pwd and I can't use options for the supported arguments. Hope you could work on these!,4
Gud site for blogging It had a draft saving option which helps me to make my blog even after power cuts,4

It is good but sometimes it created many problems in between suffering it take time to time update,4
Aayush Well,4
refresh i really miss a refresh button in the title bar when im going through forums or such. when i got sometimes bad signal receptions  the app informs me that data connection is not available and i have to go backwards through forum structure to get the page refresh  which sucks a lot. can this be fixed? otherwise great work,4
Fine,4
Decent Facebook app I've been using this app for a few years. I begun using it because the size is smaller than the official app and also the privacy. But I've stayed with it because it barely glitches and is still fast and doesn't take up much space. I would give it 5 stars but the app crashes every time I try to check my messages on it,4
Best cell empower !,4
crash sometimes with gmail  map when using gps,4
Works but needs UI updates At least it works after converting it to a system app and giving it root permissions unlike some other apps that are useless on Android 4.1.1+,4
Vincent Addae Nice to get it  it will support a lot,4
Useful app and nice interface. The downside is lack of support for multiple accounts.,4

Brilliant Many different puzzles  plenty of hours of boredom-killing  but the overall presentation and design leaves some to be desired. Would still reccommend  because you don't need to look at any puzzle games again!,4

Samsung J510FN (2016) I'm pretty sad by this app worked fine on my old &poorly Vodafone mobile  but it doesn't on a more fresher and expensive phone. It says this phone don't have compass and/or accelerometer (?). O.o I tried turn on/off that gyro thing option  but no luck.,4

Works very well Great app  does pretty much everything I need it to do. The only thing I'd ask for would be to show the # of the torrent in the list  and to be able to adjust it from the app. Other than that I can't fault it.,4

Pretty good. I like the UI and overall performance  but I'm still leery of the potential for data storage. What happens to the messages that are deleted? Are they stored on a server somewhere?,4
Good These like whats app,4
It is ok But yoi can't get all songs,4
Nice App! Would love list of daily activities below calendar This is a very nice and simple straight forward app. I also like the fact that it is standalone and does not integrate with anything else! A nice improvement will be a list displaying the start times with the title below the monthly calendar for the selected date. It will make a review of activities for the day just that much more easier. Thank you for a very nice application.,4
Itz quite good,4

Takes too long to load other than that it has the smoothest Zoom and smoothest scrolling. I think letting us choose the folders it searches will make it fast. 20 secs to load a gallery is just too long for it to be usable. Like the low permission requirements.,4

Best functionality This is a really powerful mail client  offering a range of very handy features such as PGP-integration. Unfortunately the UX is somewhat mediocre.,4
Probably the most important app on my phone  I'm using it for 10+ accounts /apps / websites. It would be great to have: - pin/fingerprint to open app or display codes - cloud backup when upgrading OS (from MM to N for example) or switching to a new/different device. - sort/order accounts,4
Definitely better than adobe digital editions,4

Pin pointing location super easy :-) Compared to other map apps this method of moving the map until the location is it in the cross hairs is ace! :-),4
Helpfull I really love the app and all the statistic features  but I would like to see a page with every status of all your habbits combined in one table (not with a line for every habbit but all the progress in just one).,4
Works great. Easy to set up and well organized menus. My only request would be more font options like colors and font size.,4
Getting bored with the interface It lacks UI customization  like resizing the clock size or adding circle border on notification and options to remove time details (day month  etc).. It also missed proximity sensor sensitivity adjust,4
Good app but it consume lot memory,4
Luv it,4
Not bad,4
Nice,4
Awesome  but sometimes doesn't work Thanks for making this sweet app! I love it to death however sometimes when i choose something to be copied  and I go to paste it  it paste a previous copied item instead. Note 5,4
One of the best alternatives to the official facebook app Just don't like it much because i'm a galaxy grand prime user and my device font is now cool juzz and if Tinfoil could support my device font it would be better,4

Its a very useful,4
Works but ui could be improved I'm using this app to listen to music stored on my ampache server. The problem is that browsing and searching is not that easy. Could you add a search (in artists song name album etc) at the same time? And a tabbed layout for switching between artist / songs /.. Would be cool and not by picking it from the list.. If you do this 5* for me. Currently I feel a bit handicapped. Would support you btw if you update it :),4
Good job. Best so far!,4
Love it I installed it on my HTC one MAX. Working perfectly. Only suggestion I can make is   if there is way you can add the feature where both front and back cameras can work at the same time. Dual recordings or pictures come handy .,4

Great app. Nice redesign Would be nice to include a navigation drawer or even action bar tabs for navigation,4
its ok for me,4
Best  but visually dated It's powerful  flexible  and has backup options. It has the best cover image options I've found  and the best search add options. The only thing I don't like is the style  which reminds me it's old every time I use it.,4
I will be there in a few minutes late but I will be there in a couple,4
Nice and its good in communication,4

Best crossword app Excellent selection of puzzles. Full of features to customize your experience. User interface is a tad clunky  but better than most. The built in keyboard is very similar to the standard Google keyboard so there's not much of an adjustment.,4
A fun addictive game. But  the gameplay is too short. If you encounter a wraith  all you see is 'wraith evaded you!' when you try and hit it. The game is beatifull and mystical  but as soon as you find something cool  like an enchanted battleaxe  potion ect  don't expect to have it for long. But the game is free  and the only purchase is a donation  unlike most apps that pressure you into buying powerups  ect with money.,4

One problem I have it set to disable mobile data when connected to a wifi. This use to work perfect on my S4 when I was was running 4.4.2. I'm now on 4.4.4 and it still mostly works except that when I'm no longer connected to a wifi it doesn't enable my mobile data again. I have to enable it by hand. If this I'd fixed it will be perfect again.,4
It's just one problem They slow my phone rame they also in running but this is could not stop. It's also busy my phone and weast my phone draining battery percentage .,4
Open source  does what it says. Is it possible to change the default behaviour of revealing the tokens though? Maybe change the default behaviour to just reveal the token instead of revealing and copying it. I use my phone as a second factor for my computer access so often times copying the token isn't necessary. Just a minor gripe.,4
Useful,4
It works It's the only one that I have found that actually works. Well done. But could you please add some customisation or change the background colour..,4
Works It works pretty well (and so do the share options)  only issue is that with sharing as HTML  there are missing characters which results in a slightly choppy (HTML) picture. And for those wanting to save locally (on device)  you can share with a cloud service (such as Google Drive) and then download it 👍,4

I have been getting more knowledgeable and skilled at MH4U  and I consider this app a godsend; such a handy wealth of information right in my hands  all offilne to boot :) This app is a must have for any hunter  especially newcomers. However  there ARE a few problems that prevent this app from truly being great: 1. Optimization - The app works fine on my main phone  a Samsung Galaxy S5  but on my backup phone which is an Alcatel model  some features don't work. Namely the Armor Set Builder; that just doesn't work at all. 2. There are no 3D renders of armor pieces or weapons; I think that would be a cool addition. 3. While I see items needed to craft Palico DLC outfits & weapons  it isn't stated in the app. There's also no mention of normal Palico outfits/weapons either. Showing this info would come in pretty handy. 4. It would be EXTREMELY useful to showcase quest trees; that is  prerequisites to a specific quest. 5. There's little to no mention of G rank quests. 6. Some information is missing  primarily related to the uses/descriptions of some items. 7. Fatalis has no materials data; everything says 0%. If those things could be addressed  then that would be 5 stars!,4
Very good app Nice,4

5x Better and Streamlined Skype Messenging The cloud storage got me sold and the sticker functionality and choice of background is amazingly artistic!

Good Its great but as soon as you uninstall it all your contacts go too,4
Great  basic application that does just what it says. Using my HX50V and basic Android phone  I can get 2-3 hours of shots before the camera battery dies. (Using an external battery pack would easily double the time.) My only complaint is it seems to miss lots of shots. For example  if you set the interval at 15s for one hour  you'd expect 240 shots. But I usually only end up with 100 or so and there are gaps of 3-5 minutes between some shots. No idea what causes it and would like to fix. Otherwise great and thanks to the dev!,4

It is so helpfull,4
Good app  UI needs overhual I really like this app however it is in desperate need of a material redesign it lags on many new devices and looks ugly and out of place,4
Good But there is not store from the program to download games,4
Pretty good. Having trouble setting up moga pocket to work. I feel like the UI as a whole needs improvement but emulation is perfect!,4

Really well designed app. Love it. I never give 5 stars,4
Have used the app for years and it worked fine. Recently my phone crashed and I can't restore from my backup.,4
I agree whole-heartedly with reviewer Amiris Brown that this application should never integrate Google Calendars except potentially as an *optional* add-on. I also agree with their thought that it would be nice to have holidays added; however  I feel this should also be an optional add-on  and should offer as great a variety of world holidays as possible  as well as moon phases. This application is great. I love it for its simplicity  its look  and for how it doesn't make me synchronize it to my Google account calendars. Thank you!,4
Good,4
Good. One minor issue I've found. This app makes for a good lock screen alternative. It claims to be simple and minimalistic  and it is. I only wish this came with an Always On option. Please add this!,4

TOR Interesting stuff,4
Takes up to much space,4
GR8 I receive more space on my phone and its fricking awesome 👌👌 more larry pics for me ;)),4
Fast and useful. It could be prettier; for example  why waste screen space with the app title and magnifying glass? Why not a floating search button and cut the page header area in half? Minor gripes for an extremely useful and well organized tool. Please keep up the good work and give me a way to support your effort without introducing ads!,4
Noble Like,4
Good app overall! No option for GPS stamp without altitude. No option to change shutter speed. No option to delay taking photo until device steady.,4
Hard to Recover From a Broken Phone I believe this app is perfect. Has a great user interface and adds so much safety to several of my accounts. The only problem is when I break my phone. It is very hard to recover and doesn't save accounts over the cloud. Once you get a new phone  you have to reconnect all of your accounts.,4
Nice,4
Nice Work well,4
Widget missing Love the simplicity. Would like to have widget shortcuts to the options so that i don't need to go into the app everytime to go to recovery or bootloader or soft reboot,4

Nice. I like the new highlight for the bookmarked verses. I have also solved my previous issue (not allowed to move huge files to SD card) by manually moving the modules directory and then hand-editing the files under mods.d to reflect the new locations. Works fine now.,4
This is amazing,4
Haaaaaa Very happy to say that it is a good app for use,4
Much better... However  cannot set an image from media library as a Featured Image. Only images uploaded from device can be set as Featured Image,4
Really great But i think 1.) Must have a double tap to change wallpaper feature at will option. And 2.) Must have a plugin for TapDeck,4
Nice The app does what it says! I have a voyagerr2 tablet! It just wouldn't stay connected to WiFi this helped a lot. I'm not savvy on this stuff. But it gets me online! Thank you very much!,4
Beyond Impressive This is the only game I've found that runs without stuttering and it's pinball! To top it off  it's under 3mb!! I really hope to see other vector graphics games  and some way to give you Bitcoins? 5* For creating genuine quality software for Android  I'm speechless! Edit: I will admit  the flippers sometimes straight up do not respond  not sure why because the fps doesn't slow down or anything  it's at least 1/3 of my outs :(. Hitting both paddles at once fails 75% of time.,4
Generally liking it  except... ... I'd love to see a feature for a different wallpaper than the one from home screen. That would be great!,4
Be?? app,4
One issue preventing me from awarding 5 stars - I'm on the East coast  if that makes a difference  and maybe this only happens when timed events have all ended  but All Day events disappear before the end of the day (11:59pm) on the actual home screen widget. All day events  regardless of what else is or is not on the calendar  should be there actually ALL DAY.,4

Sometimes when you send messages from another phone like an IPhone to the android version of linguine it shows the previous message send by them but duplicated and you have to exit out of the thread view and back in to see the real message. Also the app would be 5 stars if it had VPN client in it so only phone calls and sip traffic get sent over VPN,4

Gr8 app but It is an awesome app  but it needs to reduce the permissions required for installation. I should be able to export the list of apps locked as XML  and later import it . This will save long time when device is formatted  and you have to again go through list of apps to be blocked,4

Nice and simple! Not loaded with useless features. I really love this app its exactlly what I need. Except for one thing you can backup you your clipboard but there has to be a better way to sync it with all your devices. Maybe some type of cloud sync. Backing it up and restoring can be very tedious especially when you use the clipboard as much as I do. Still great job. I'll give 4 stars when sync issue is improved.,4
In app menu for s5 It would be much appreciated if we could have an in app menu for input for s5. Thanks,4

Still does its job While the look is a bit outdated and possibly needs an update  the functionality is still there. So in short: not beautiful  but reliable.,4
*updated review* You have to admire the dedication the devs have to this app... Gives the info you need without any bloat. After a couple years of using this app my only criticism is it is in need of a UI update   looks clunky in the age of material design.,4

I always liked Moto X's lockscreen notification compared to stock Android's default notification. Wave to wake never seemed to work but notification still works on both my Nexus device running Marshmallow and Nougat. Definitely better than using the built-in Ambient Display which uses more battery.,4
I am not able to get notification on lock screen,4
Very nice App.. Needs Themes The App is beautifully designed  love the colors.. Would be much better if.. Themes were Added like a dark theme.. Integration with Google tasks or Reminders would be nice.. Also a swipe option to Snooze like Inbox by Google gives would be great.. A Custom Notification Sound would also be a good touch.. Maybe even a premium version with these options..Anyways keep the Updates Rolling Devs n Thank you for the beautiful App👍,4

Great app I use this mainly as a read-only database. I never copy my password to the buffer. I just read it and manually input it wherever it is needed. I manually sync the db every month. So far it works great.,4
Nice Widget Would love it if the event dates  times and location colors could be set similar to event headers. They seem stuck at light grey color and with my custom background shade they are hard to read.,4
Nice but no security option,4
"I think a lot of reviewers have missed the point of this app. If all you want to do is send a regular SMS though your phone's provider then this probably isn't the app for you. It is most powerful when coupled with WebSMS  allowing me to automatically send messages for certain number prefixes through a cheaper web-based provider. My first complaint is that it could look a little prettier. It's not as ugly as WebSMS but a little padding around the text could make all the difference. Perhaps the developer wanted to fit as much text on the screen as possible but screens are relatively large and high resolution these days. The """"""""""""""""Black"""""""""""""""" theme is also more like grey under the Material Glass theme for some reason. With those two issues fixed  it would look much like the stock Messaging app. My next complaint is that starting a new thread fires up the WebSMS interface instead of allowing you to type into SMSdroid directly. This inconsistency is a little jarring and there seems little reason for it. I guess SMSdroid is simply lacking a recipient selector. My last complaint is a minor one. The multi-select button doesn't actually do anything. All in all  a thumbs up from me.""""",4

Had to uninstall. I really like the features of this app. It messed up the normal paste function on my Nexus 5 rooted but stock ROM. I could no longer paste anything anywhere. Thanks and I would keep trying after your updates  but they are non existent!,4
Great calculator - terrible widget. The widget doesn't work too well. Not for Nova launcher anyways. Edit: I will do when I get home.,4
Good but I expect more The UI really doesn't live up to googles standards but does what it should and is intuitive to use,4
Great app just needs a few additions This is a fantastic app for someone coming from the Motorola ecosystem that misses the active display as badly as I did. There needs to be a way to swipe the media player out of the way to access the normal acdisplay screen. There also needs to be an addition that brings up acdisplay when the phone is picked up after sitting for a set period of time. I have issues with the proximity wake but pulling it out of my pocket always seems to work. Otherwise this is a fantastic app!,4
Lol Lol,4
Used for quite some time I have always been delighted with this app but recently it seems to entirely hog resources when checking mail. This is a particular difficulty in a poor service areas. The wee circles just sit there blocking any activity on the phone until you give up. There seems nothing that can be done to stop the sync happening in this case other than switch off. Nexus 6 latest Android.,4

Great podcatcher... 5 stars if... ...the play button on the widget was able to unpause. Workaround is to simply to pull up the full app and press play from there.

Works well for offline data collection This is great for offline data collection. My only wish is that it had a better mechanism for alerting you if a form has an error in the way it was created  rather than just crashing.,4

Simply elegant. I switched over from QuickPic and don't regret it at all. However  it does bother me that when you change the primary color of the app  the actual app color doesn't change (i.e. app switcher still shows the app as orange). Other than that  I still enjoy using this brilliantly simple app. Why isn't this the way Google Photos works?!,4

Nextcloud and this app is great  I switched over from Pydio a month ago and I couldn't be happier. The auto upload doesn't work for me however. Sometimes it uploads but mostly it doesn't. I'm on a Nexus 5x with android 7.1.2,4
Good,4
Right level of customization Has enough options to be useful and interface is easy to use,4
For self-hosted sites as well :) Didn't work first with self-hosted sites  but apparently Ubuntu xenial doesn't install php-xml by default while Trusty did (default LAMP install). To bad it doesn't do single sign on when you go to view the admin settings for example (starts webbrowser),4
Password Love it  will give it 5 if you add a password  PIN or something to it.,4
Great app but... Great app  but does it now support Apple Music for Android?,4
Fit app,4
The new update with themes... i don't like that + voice calls,4
Great  still work to do I've used the app for a little while now and the feature I've used the most is sharing videos from the youtube app to play them on kodi. First thing that I noticed is that when I want to watch another video when the one I'm already watching is not finished  it does not play it  I have to stop the other video first. Also  for no reasons  it sometimes replay the same video when finished or  when my video is finished and I share another one  sometimes it plays the video that I just watched  or it does nothing.,4
I don't know anything I just wanted to rate it.,4
It works... Does exactly what u would expect it to do.,4
Nice,4
A very nice one.,4

"Came back to this after trying ComicRack I actually tried Comic Rack (Paid version) and didn't like it  so I went back to this one. This reader has a simple interface. ComicRack's interface actually made it hard to read and enjoy a comic. Every time I tried to go to the next page  it zooms in. Although Comics Reader doesn't have a zoom function (minus 1 star)  it's fine with me. I just switched from my 7"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tablet to my 10"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tablet. I may try out Challenger Comics Viewer and see if it's better.""""",4
Functional & Reliable NEEDS CONVERSATION VIEW as well as MATERIAL DESIGN update.,4
Mostly good app I like the game and enjoy playing it. The only thing I think is missing are the bonus points for placing your single block last.,4
I tested this app by comparing the quality of a range of images taken by this app  other top (free & paid) camera apps on the Play Store  and the default Android camera app; and the conclusion is that this app generates the highest quality photos  with the slight tradeoff of slow capture time. In my opinion  that is a worthy tradeoff. To the developer(s): If the capture speed could be improved this app would truly be perfect! Thank you for this amazing app  and keep up the great work!,4
Nice one Adding backup/restore will make it perfect.,4
Like Good,4
Hangouts nice,4
It seems InstantUpload is working again. Thanks! There is one thing I miss in the app: It would be awesome to be able to decide whether InstantUpload should upload images or videos when connected to 3G/4G or edge/2G in addition to WiFi only (like FolderSync from Tacit Dynamics does). Regards,4
Very good and easy,4

Great app  some suggestions Better than the stock camera app on my phone  so very happy about that. Would love to see a way to quickly switch between regular and slow motion video though,4
Its a very good and useful thing for every android phone,4
Samsung screwed the pooch! Worked perfect for every note except the note 4. Not the app's fault.. Other than that it rocks!,4
Missing feature I like that very much. However  there is one feature that missing: a key to sent out a page link to other people using messages  emails  etc.,4
Great idea! This is brilliant so far. Play command doesn't work at all on my Oneplus 3 with 6.01 it just force closes T-UI after I press space. Would be fantastic if this concept could be merged with Termux eventually so everything is in one app.,4
Glitching Solid black background.,4
Nice But needs UI IMPROVEMENTS.,4
Dark Theme needed!!,4
Basic file manager  but why only list view? I'd prefer to have files in rows and columns  not a long vertical list. I deleted ES file explorer and opted for this because they've run the app in the ground. I'd really like a better view.,4
Send text feature not working. It was working previously but it isn't any longer. When the Kodi keyboard comes up  I have to move the remote arrows around and type manually rather than send the text like I was able to. Thanks for looking into it.,4

Simple and effective Easy to log and review. Though the data backup and restore is built in  it's not automated. In case you want to transfer logs to new device  you will need to export and import the file manually.,4
Please fix photo upload I must say  this app is super nice  when ever I feel like doing something random (which is all the time) I just go on this app and get creative but lately there has been a problem with picture upload  please fix when can.,4
Good alternative to Squeeze Commander Very good  but several features could be added eg wake-on-lan  app support  faster artwork loading (caching),4
not perfect  but the best there is... ...on android ... beware there are rip-offs that just add ads... this uses chrome too  so it's not that different either,4

Good  but achievements don't work Tracking progress is broken in this app  which takes some of the fun away learning with Khan Academy. I watched 3 videos  but 2 didn't get tracked at all against my progress  and 1 for only 11 seconds...,4
Good,4
I liked how it worked but it just was a little slow,4
Too many ad.. but good,4
Good,4
Great app! But you should be able to rank the scores  highest to lowest  lowest to highest and order the contestants in alphabetical order  etc. I would give a 5 if you include a ranking system,4
Its new version No problems functions well,4
Easy to use,4
Good luck PPSSPP,4

I like this app It helps me many of what i want,4
Nice & Simple Like the clean interface of this app. It would be nice to have a feature that would let us set a reminder for a specific day & time in future.,4

It works very well.,4
Great app! I use it all the time. Would still like some more stats (and ways to view stats) as well as being able to filter play stats the same way I can my collection  but other than that it's very useful  and as long as it continues to be updated I'm sure it will only get better.,4

I like it because is very fast  but I usually search for files  folders.,4
Love the app - needs tablet support The app works great on my Galaxy S5 Sport but on my Galaxy Tab S the screen response is a bit laggy and it doesn't zoom to fit screen in tablet landscape mode.,4
Great but one issue Great app  but for some reason it isn't counting the number of dimes right. It says 7  but I only count 6. Also it shows a blank game with 7 plays in the play stats. H index is also 13 but I count it as 12. I think it may be counting the games I don't own.,4
Very good,4
Easy to use Could have better search indexing.,4
Good,4
Works. Takes a bit of work to get ready. Somewhat confusing setup and directions. Lags a little  especially on sound and crashes frequently  but I fixed this by tinkering with the settings. Occasional graphical glitching  usually nothing too major. Other than that  it works. Keep in mind I've only played Code Veronica.,4
Bug? After downloading and installing a plugin  when I exit and enter the app the plugin disappears.,4
No *.CHM support. Other then that  thumbs up.,4
Useful app.,4
Loved it Takes up too much battery though,4
Be better if it could launch too Does what it says it does  which is great. But for me it would be nice if it could start an app on my phone  from the list.,4
Good app I would really like if I could see the time of alarm (and icon) when I set alarm below main clock and date. Also I can not set image as wallpaper on lock screen different from the image on home screen.,4
Only send for messages.,4

"Only proper E-mail client I found  but some issues 1. Hierarchical folders are flattened to an oversized list of all folders.

Love it. But one bug with volume I want to go through cards at night with no volume. However  with each card  the volume on my phone increases by 1. Hard to get flowing when I have to keep turning volume down every few cards. But great app! Happy to rate 5 with this fixed or some workaround,4
I like the crossword puzzle program but After the update I can't delete puzzles... Fixable? I think the older program had a more efficient use of space. Update seems to waste more space. I'm using an LG g3 phone. FOLLOW UP: Major problems all fixed! I use this every day! Love it! And a very responsive app maker!,4
The best of Google service if you have any problems clear the cache on this app disable this app turn off the phone wait for 5 minutes turn on the phone reenable this app update the app again and you'll be fine,4
Google messenger Downloaded on my s6 edge to anable flash notification. Works great so far. FYI it will not enable until you get a notification. You can then allow or disallow in the settings.,4
It very good,4
Cloud Service Integration Design and functions are great. I am just missing a link to cloud storages like Dropbox or Google Drive  with which I could upload entire folders. It would also be great to have a search function in the app manager.,4
cant block all apps. still apps using data while apps are blocked in netguard  mi-xplore arcai netcut and built in  need some extra features like real Vpn too.,4
Nice,4
Pretty cool Really simple to use. I had a question though. Why is there no logout option? And how does it manage to get user data even after clearing data and cache from app settings??,4
Perfectly minimal Provides just the right notifications in an alluringly bare lockscreen  free of the usual clutter. An update adding some security features (PIN  Password  Pattern  etc.) and I would rate it a perfect Five Star.,4
It's an awesome app  but unfortunately Daxter keeps freezing on me when I get to the end of the train chase. I noticed this happened for other people when I watched some YouTube videos  but for them is lasted a few seconds  for me it's permanent. I can't get past that part now. Hopefully this is fixed at some point,4

Messaging... I understand that you have no control over the lock out on messaging. But  god damn...there is little functionality over the chrome browser instance. I'm not installing messenger  so this isn't going to work for me. I guess it's time to quit FB.,4

Needs slight improvement When measuring angles the reading jumps around too much requiring you to figure an average. It would be helpful if there was a way to average the reading automatically . Similar to damping on an analog meter.,4
Go,4
This is a wonderful app  and works far better than one would think being free. The devs came up with a simple solution for the lower screen it can be switched between controls and screen by pressing a button. There is a problem where games animation will be slower on all but the simpliest games  but it is updated fairly regularly so it is running far better than when it first launched. So I can see it dissapearing in a year or two. Beyond that everything else works wonderful.,4
It's good I do not like that the colors change as I Zoom in and out on the mandelbrot set.,4
Works well  but... It would be nice if I could scan a code that is already in my phone as an image.,4
I'm pretty amazed at this emulator.. I really wasn't holding out much hope... but I can now play Dreamcast games on my phone! Only tested a few titles - Virtua Tennis 1 & 2 and Resident Evil Code Veronica... there are a couple of glitches on the tennis games but they're totally full-speed and completely playable.. and I'm blown away at how well Code Veronica (one of my favourite games) works. Would love to see this emulator improved with a slightly better UI and some extras like Save States. Also I had some problems with the touch-screen controls (they were slightly off) but I use a bluetooth controller anyway as touch-screen is awful (8BitDo Nes30 Pro) and that works great with this emulator. All in all SO impressed and hope this gets some good support - I would definitely pay for this emulator if it meant that more improvements were made... 5 Stars if the UI fixes and save states are implemented.,4
I would like darker theme for this app,4
Yummy app,4
Like it's a great app I like it it's day. I can find everything I need music videos whatever,4

Love it  but... I really like this app. The one thing that is slightly vexing is when I refresh the feeds  the running downloads don't always show what's downloading. Just now I refreshed and it didn't seem be working  then a few minutes later I see I have new podcast episodes but never saw them being downloaded.,4
Challenging The main appeal of the gane is the difficulty its hard but you keep on trying to win But the problem is you stave too fast and its really hard to find food most of the time and you never find an item you can have cause your stregth is always low and its impossible to get it higher,4
Nice Nice app I like this,4
I like it,4
Good app I am happy with this app,4
Fine free app I use this app to listen to professional education podcasts on my interminable train commute. Solid and reliable  my only suggestion would be to modernize the interface just a tad.,4
runs great but... games like berserk get a bit glitchy and im still waiting for triggerheart to be fully compatible... but Reicast is still a very awesome working emulator to get.,4
It's nice...,4
Wow,4
This truly is a great RPG game at it's core. Simple  yet difficult. It's D&D. Which is great. Although at times the Hit Chance seems to take a mind of it's own (89%? No I think there is a decimal point missing there...8.9 sounds more correct with my playthrough haha) The only gripe I have at the moment is that gold is really hard to come by. Loot is worth nothing and healing items are impossibly expensive. Would it be possible to add (Or maybe it's there and I can't find it?) a way to actually cook the meat that we find as loot? It's the only way I can see that I 'm going to be able to actually finish this quest. Monsters get far too strong far too fast and without money I can't get past it.,4
It's very easy to use,4
Humble by its effectiveness,4

Good app but missing voice and video calling😡😡,4
Hey  Love it   thanks! keep up the great work. Is everything op and hard to fight for a reason  do you have to grind to get anywhere? Maybe I am missing something  idk  its pretty difficult. What do you suggest? Also when your player moves  the back ground moves instantaneous  giving it a sort of lagging look  even thought it isn't laggy  that way it moves it hard on the eye and makes it difficult to move and dodge dangerous creatures for me anyway. If that could be fixed It would give it a full 5 starts!!! Cuz other then that its a pretty cool game :),4

Love it! I love this app. The only thing I suggest the makers add is an option for me to store everything on my SD card instead of the phone. Then this would be a 5 star app.,4

Low atualization The time it take to insert the new content of PRD is always too late.,4
Excellent  simple backup navigation. *updated review* You have to admire the dedication the devs have to this app... Gives the info you need without any bloat. After a couple years of using this app my only criticism is it is in need of a UI update   looks clunky in the age on material design.,4
Best informative application,4
Good one,4

Good simple app ! If we analyze users complaints  we find that Wifi on/off should be made advanced similar to programming logic with priority order for different options  AND/OR logic for combinations of multiple options  then it would become perfect advanced app. E.g. Wifi off at night  on in morning daily  off during specified office hours due to restrictions i.e. multiple on/off time setting. Wifi on at home during weekends.,4

Almost perfect On one hand  it is the first of the USB diag apps that I have seen that gives this rather important piece of info: is the device connected in USB 3 or 2? 5-star material right there. On the other  when you tell it to download the vendor info (2.5 MB as it tells you)  it gets stuck on file 2/3 at 3%. And we can't have that  can we? Then after you kill it  it won't start anymore. So -1 star until it is fixed.,4

Minetest is a great FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) voxel game  It's similar to Minecraft  but does not strive to be like it.

Pretty Good Game This is a good game. It has good characters  and a good plot. It's extremely basic  and had no sound  but is still worth the time. Quick tip: kill the rabid dogs and sell the meat to get lots of coins. Edit: Good job developers  you had a great game and abandoned it.The game was great  until it hadn't been updated in two years.,4

Comprehensive but not fun to use. I prefer Wakelock Detector. It's so much more intuitive and probably 95% as functional. The 'feel' is better which causes me to go to it by default. However when I REALLY need to get to the bottom of a battery issue BetterBatteryStats is more effective.,4

Works exactly as advertised but It doesn't dim the light enough for my needs like Twilight does. Don't know if it's something developer can change or if it's android night mode limitation. But thks for the easy set up  it's a really cool feature,4
Excellent Brings Ambient Display to most phones. Love the 'wave to wake' feature. My only issue is that I wish lock screen feature could replace my system luck screen rather than sitting on top if it. System limitation I guess. Great app!,4

This app is amazing! By far one of the best ones out there. With little to no problems this app has become my favorite. I do have one request though. Can you please add two things. 1: can you please add in a rainbow wheel thing so I could have a larger variety of colors? That would be amazing. And 2: It sould be even better if you can add a feature where you click on the color and that becomes the color you use. If you could do that  I would love it  thanks!,4
Great App! Absolutely love this app. The only thing missing is Unchained. If this had it 5 stars all the way,4
Good but... Everything is good but in this update the settings don't stick 50% of the time. In earlier versions I didn't experience such problem. Please fix it for a 5 star!,4

Working much better now! Been checking for years to see if this app worked right. Only ever worked with my first smartphone but now after some time it works good enough to guess what I'm look at. Happy for that but it still seems a bit off.,4

Resolution Settings show 8MP max but my Nexus 6 is 13MP. Can this be fixed? I also would like to see auto flash. I understand it's a simple camera but I think auto flash would make it even more simple.,4

Alright,4
Please add icon pack support Great app! I'm missing a feature to support icon packs  would this be possible?,4
Awesome but some images disappear when phone restarted It's great but every time I restart my phone  some image folders disappear(turn black) and so I'm forced to remove those images and re add them. Please fix that and you'll have that 5?....from Xperia P running cyanogenmod android 4.4.4.,4

Work as intended Awesome  app works as intended. The only thing missing is Exchange 2010 & 365 support. Only feature that would be missing from the app for me.,4
Closes to launcher on my S3 SGH-747m. Works on my GPD Q9. Anyone not getting Skies of Arcadia to work: try a different image. Make sure it is a clean rip and not the one with some teams intro added to the image. That one is garbage. Interface needs some work  especially the in-game one as I don't know what any of the symbols represent. I've tried Crazy Taxi and Skies of Arcadia and they both work.,4

Very useful Works well for viewing open document files. Wish it had a few more features though.,4
Latest version has a bug where if you listen to a voice message while holding the phone to your cheek  the audio will come out through the main speaker and not the earpiece. This means that if you wanted to listen to a voice message privately it would be blasted to everyone else. Please fix and I will change my rating to 5 stars.,4
Awesome apk,4
Enhanced Same features and then some. Thanks!,4

It's good but not the best because it's sometimes showed parodys and remixes but I still like tho,4

The ONLY music downloader! Every other app only allows you to save songs within the app  and not transfer them to another device. This app allows you to download  save  and OWN the music. There is no other app that works this way,4
"Attractive  useful SMS default replacement. This app offers your choice of background colors  delivery confirmation  access to send from notification bar  works with """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Should I Answer?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and is ad free. You may donate  if you like  through the app. Unfortunately  MMS does not work on my Moto G because my SIM shows multiple APN's  none of which is my phone company.

Dying to a simple rat because you didn't have a biscuit to eat is annoying. Increase the random food generator and I'd give it 5 stars.""""",4
Great app! This program is super simple and it works exactly how you would expect. Easy interface as well. Just works!,4
Okey Okey,4
Very helpful!,4
Good app  could use much needed improvements Good app  does the job. Here are a few improvementd this app desperately needs: (samsung GS4) Use an other time selection for the rotation timer  this one doesnt go above 9h  and is badly designed. Add the option to blacklist certain wallpapers. A few more effects to the advanced tab  like sepia or Hue. Otherwise it's great  get it if you use an icon pack!,4
Bubble Level Works better without the phone protector/case but still accurate and easy to use.,4
Too jumpy Too many quirks but a good app,4
Masks support ruined it Last update fixed the ugly masks problem nice work make I funny icon,4
Cool Works very well  but if I can give you an advice  it is to make an icon that fits the fullHD resolution,4
Samsung Galaxy S7 Android 6.0 I love the app drawer from CyanogenMod and the TouchWiz one is pretty terrible. One thing I miss is badges on app icons to show number of notifications or messages. Might be a deal breaker in the end but giving this a go for a few days.,4
Good  but Doesn't Preserve Group Threads The app does what it says  and it does it well. My one complaint is that it breaks up group conversations into individual-to-individual messages when it backs them up. Thus  a group text between user A and friends X  Y  and Z gets backed up not like a group e-mail thread  but instead as three separate threads: texts between A & X  A & Y  and A & Z. This makes reconstructing the flow of the text conversation between multiple persons *very* difficult and impractical.,4
You can make ringtone & add to each one I like it,4

It is good,4
Useful for any google,4
New version running better Since my previous review  the app has improved greatly. I haven't noticed it skipping songs when buffering. The big improvement I see is adding play/pause/skip to the lock screen when the app is playing. This also connects into bluetooth devices like the Jambox. I can pause my playlist or skip a story from my Jambox. Great addition! A pet-peeve of mine with the app is the confirmation dialog every time I clear the playlist. I primarily use the app for news stories so I clear the playlist daily to remove outdated segments. A better solution would be to allow playing of all segments in a program (ie. Morning Edition) without adding them to the playlist. If you added a way for me to donate to the app  via Paypal for instance  I would give!,4

Great app Works for me. Music  flix or watever.,4
Additional Features needed. I have been using this app for over 4 months now. I really love it but one thing I find should be there which obviously isn't is the ability to choose which part of the image is displayed on the screen or the ability to resize it so everything comes in. (This is for the updated paintings everyday),4
Helpful I think this app is very helpful and useful but some items to not have a description over all good app,4
Nice App Only improvement that I recommend is a play all button that easily plays a series of pod casts. Currently I need to add each one to my queue.,4

App is great  features are way ahead of the competitors. However  active channels and groups push individual chats down making it difficult to keep up. Kindly considering having 2 tabs to separate individual chats from groups/channels for easy accessibility,4

Needs a couple more features. On top of what's already pretty great I'd suggest adding a settings option to change how many show up in history in the notification  also a button to collapse the notification. Other then that I think its pretty fantastic. If I think of anymore suggestions I'll be sure to add them here.,4

Excellent App for Nexus 7 Eventually found this app after trying and rejecting many other catalogue apps. Functionality was exactly what I needed. Interface was reasonably intuitive (to an android/touch screen newbie!). A key requirement was to be able to export/import book data. This was achievable by means of a file management application (to get the file back onto the Nexus  which has no micro SD card) and an appropriately formatted CSV file. Note that Excel cannot format the file correctly  but LibreCalc can. Only thing I couldn't fathom out was how to get the same book onto multiple shelves. Other than that I'm very satisfied.,4

This is a great little app  but two problems. 1) it's way  way too easy to accidentally delete puzzles - even puzzles you've solved! If I pick up my phone wrong and accidentally drag across the screen  I'm liable to lose them with no way of getting them back. 2) the error checker isn't really clear what is wrong - I wish it highlighted all letters that are currently wrong separately from which ones were wrong previously.,4

Only it should use arrows for best moves in analyze mode like droidfish. And board search should have option to search only one side(white or black) piece positions. If possible it should show players clock times for pgn files with move times.( FICS ICC FIDELIVE pgn) And should show move times chart. Wish you all best!!!,4

One of the best but... Sadly  the set builder doesn't function correctly. When I select a gear piece the app crashes. Also the quests list is outdated since it doesn't have some of the newer dlc quests. Overall it's still one of the best out there for the hunter on the go. Other than fixing the set builder  it would be nice to see the sizes for crowns on each monsters' info and a search bar for the monsters list.,4

I would like to see only stories I can listen to or add to my playlist. Not articles for reading. Would make me love this app even more.,4
I really like this app.,4
pretty great  three problems. 1: the cover image of every book shows up twice in my phone's gallery  flooding it with images. wish the app would save them internally and hide them from the gallery. 2: forces its own formatting instead of allowing the book to decide. i have several books that switch between centered and aligned  but fbreader forces only allows one way. 3. there was an error in one of the books i loaded into fbreader  so i deleted it  pulled a fixed version onto my phone  and hit rescan. what's in my book list? the original non-fixed version. i deleted the book again  uninstalled fbreader  used a root-explorer to remove every trace of the app and book  re-installed  put the new book version in. and it STILL showed the old version. what gives?,4
So good app,4

Really the best app ever for free music  but about 75% of the music I search isn't there. So maybe a big song update? Also after downloading some songs you either find out they couldn't download or are not the right songs. A resolve to that would be being able to preview the song before downloading it. I would also give 5 stars if you fix it! Will forever use this app though as long as it keeps up.,4

Good. I get a lot of enjoyment from it. A few niggling issues like the keyboard that I don't care for but danged good.,4

Pretty good. Works really well  and I like how you cam add things to collections. But  I wish the bookshelf view would work for each collection instead of all books  much like iOS's does. Also would be nice if you couldn't add the same book twice. Sometimes when I add things manually I forget if I added it from x source  and even though the names are the same  it creates a duplicate. Oh another thing that needs to be implemented  NEEDS  is a way to reorganize book positions  for book series and such.,4
Nice,4
Long time favorite Still works fine except it doesn't seem to scrub the clipboard on my Galaxy S7 anymore... An interface update would be nice too ;),4
Wonderful I have been using this live wallpaper for months  because I change my wallpaper so much. With this I am able to have all of my favorites all in once place and they change with the time setting I set. Lately ever since flashing android 5.0 the app crashes. Please fix. Thank you,4
I wish it could support even lower version of Android like 4.0.4 than I would have been great,4
thnx please next time make ps2 and ps vita emulators.,4

Needs more customization available This app could easily get 5 stars if it could set custom destruct time  add user photos  hide secret chats  change app theme. Other than these few drawbacks the app is awesome. Mostly I would like to hide the secret chats and set a custom destruct time. Also if it is possible delete it only from one side of the convo under the approval of the other party or parties.,4
This app works great in conjunction with phpsysinfo  but it's a bit simplistic  and doesn't have all the features of the web interface. Please keep implementing features  and I will gladly donate money.,4

Just wondering is it limited by dashclock that you can't create an extension that shows all the app notifications without select the particular one? Coz I'm just too spoiled by iOS. Lol. Great work.,4
Nice app It must help for improvement in maths in 3 section.,4
Nice,4
Good selection of puzzles So far this app is mostly expectations. Good selection of puzzles some more difficult than others. Navigation takes a bit of getting used to. My only criticism is with the nyt puzzle. I've only had the app two weeks but so far the nyt has been the same puzzle both weeks. I see someone else commented on that too. So only 4 stars. If nyt updates then I'll give 5,4
It is perfect  but only thing I need is keyboard support. When I typing some credentials for service it is difficult to type on remote control via CEC (displayed keyboard on-screen). Will be keyboard support in future release?,4
Need improvements The app is good. But still some of the function need to update. (1) There is no slideshow function for photos in a folder. (2) For video's there shall be preview even before user open the video  so that user may have idea about video contains what. Hoping this bare simple function will be incorporated at the earliest. Otherwise no worthful to installing.,4
very well,4
Useful app to save battery The only criticism i have of this app is that there is no option to stop it from turning on mobile data when there is an active Wi-Fi connection.,4

Well organized. Have to download programs to guarantee reliable playback as streaming often results in backward jumps by a few seconds or ending a program prematurely  but that may be a weakness of any podcast app which interprets a hesitation in internet connection (?). I don't know. Never have that problem with videos  but frequently with podcast players.,4

Search Result - Insta-Crash !!! (Resolved) Every time a select one of the results from a search the app immediately and completey crashes. I paid for the app. If this is not redponded to and dealt with ASAP  then I will be requesting a refund. Buyer beware !!! 09-13-16 REPLY TO DEV: I have sent the crash file with an eplaination several times since it occred the first time and never recieved any response. Now what? 09-19-16 UPDATE: Reset phone  reinstalled on phone instead of SDcard. Better; adding stars.,4

"A no fuss file manager that isn't a bloated piece of rubbish. Replaced my old simple file manager due to it not being updated in 2 years. This app gets the job done.

Fixed night mode but zooming is a little dysfunctional.. I love the latest update with night mode and thank you so much for fixing the color problem for older versions of android. My one small issue echoes what I've seen others say as far as the zooming not being very smooth or working great. It can take a few attempts to get everything to be the right size. I still love this app and use it the most. Content and simplicity are 5 stars period... Samsung GS 4,4

Best Lockscreen App I have been using this lockscreen for a couple of days now and I really like it. It is very user-friendly as it runs really smoothly. One thing I want on the next update is an option to put a lockscreen code or pattern. Other than that  this app is perfect!,4

The program cannot get my location from the GPS  always shows 0.0 degrees latitude and 0.0 degrees longitude. So the picture of the sky looks like I'm in Africa (which I'm not) unless I set my location manually. Other programs on the phone show my correct GPS coordinates.,4
Finally supporting HX90v! Great app!,4
Its amazing,4
Very nice Very nice,4
Please Add a TalkBack Widget! Much improved from 4 years ago! Thank you for improving this app. My only pet peeve now is that there is no TalkBack widget and the two-step shortcut in stock Android on a Nexus 6p is rather cumbersome  and if you don't time it right you accidentally end up turning the phone off! Please add a widget so that low vision users can toggle Talkback on and off with the press of ONE button  or add the ability for users to turn TalkBack on and off with Google Now.,4
Some good puzzles Plenty to challenge your mind just need to persevere with a couple to get the hang of them.,4
must be mantioned i like the app but I found in the. last update new emoji is like messed up... i liked the older version then the new one  because it messes up with fb smiles and few my friends cant see the smiles. please add the function to chose the smiles. old and new version for example... thank you 😃,4

LG Mach (LS860)  ICS 4.0.4. Maps to my physical slider keyboard--- ---Nice to be able to type in Hebrew with real keys. Only wish is a small screenshot in the corner of the display in case I forget the layout; the big one should disappear to allow for easy copy view  and does so nicely. Music  scientific  symbol and technology keyboards would also be nice. Predictive text & dictionary not important; I trust my skillset. Working well with my hardware takes priority over those criteria.,4
Sources It is a very premium app  for no cost. It does it's job well  but it would be nice if it could support multiple sources and use a random source daily. Other than that  I would heavily recommend it.,4
Satisfactory,4

Sleek  simple and useful A great app for keeping track of recurring activities with minimum fuss - one feature that I would like to see would be to allow creation of (and sorting by) different categories  so not everything is on one long list. For instance  I would like to have a list of daily activities  and other lists of longer-term goals that I only do once a week or so,4
For epub format I found it very useful but did'nt like it for pdf after downloading plugin.thats why 4 stars.,4
Can't convert to any other formats! It seems to be working fine and open odt file and other formats  can edit copy and paste- but the major point that it couldn't show anything else in future tools. Probably not bad.,4
Quite good,4
Good App. I would like to have one more option Its a great app. Helped me lot when my phone power button got damaged. I would like to have one more feature. Waking up by double tapping the screen.

ODS file issues My open calc file has three columns. The second columns can span several lines. I find out if reading on android device the second column will stretch out in one single line and overlap the third column so I cannot really make out the two columns at all. In my original document there is no carriage return for the data in the second column but I still think the viewer itself should be intelligent enough to recognize the column width to break things into as many lines as required so it won't overflow into neighbouring columns,4

Amazing and addicting! I love the game despite my lack of experience with roguelikes. Still haven't beaten it yet but I play it constantly. One thing I might recommend though is rebalancing he hunger and food  either make satiety points decrease slower  increase the potency of food and the satiety point cap  or increase the frequency of food drops. Starvation has been the thing that killed me the most  and I'm very sparing with any food I get only eating when starving. Would be 5 stars if not for the hunger!,4

Works fine. I wish there was an option in the Eye Care Mode to dim blue screen dots alone  so that e.g. blacks would not become reddish. Now if I want to reduce blue light  I have to accept increased amount of other light  yet I would like it to stay unchanged instead  or better yet have an option to dim it too  separately.,4
Nice I like the new interface. One usability suggestion though. When searching for an entry  do live search/update/filtering after each keypress instead of requiring to finish the search input with a return key and then do the search. Much quicker for the user and I don't think performance will be an issue with the amount of data a typical user's password file might contain (a few hundred of entries max).,4
Useful Works well,4
Awesome app,4
Nice app It's pretty good for tracking your collection and plays. Wish the play stats were better though. Also wish I could see which people I play with have the most wins  most popular teams/colors  etc.,4
big security flaw! read - v good app but does not clear the clipboard after copying a password! not even after the time delay is up or you lock your database - ppl can paste your last password again. do what i did - get tasker and set it to fill up the clipboard with some sentence that should clear it. you need x20+ different sentences or items to fill up the clipboard or get some app but test it actually clears the clipboard because the popular one I tested did not... best to be sure whatever you do... but its still a good app!,4
Awesome  can find pretty much any song,4

Excellent Still don't know why it needs to be showing in the notifications constantly. Otherwise 5 stars.,4
A status update feature can be really useful. Don't make it all funky of course like social networking but a simple option to let everyone know something recent about you,4
Usefull Needs clearity on zoom in. Needs image save options with date time.,4
It is,4
9/10 give the daaaamn possibility of pinning important messages like whatsapp does with the starred messages. It'd make telegram perfect.,4

One of the best wallpaper changers around This is one of the best wallpaper changers around. If the settings / controls were easier to manage I'd five it 5 stars.,4
Useful and solid Regularly updated  decent layout and probably my favourite pathfinder app. Also it's free.,4
My problem is when it restores SMS Texts it starts with the Oldest ones  if you could start with the Most Resent ones it would be great. I don't see any setting to do that. I'd like a response from the developer.,4
Luther Hhhhhh,4
Offline mode does not work Offline used to be the main point of this app  but it is not working anymore. Also it would be nice if instead of selecting pages one by one it would download all pages linked from a particular page for offline use.,4
Super Nice application,4
Some short gaps between next file...,4
High quality app Just wish it had more qr code types in the share menu for generating codes.,4

Good for learning to play piano by yourself The app works great on my tablet and aside for some small bugs in functionality is perfect for learning to play songs on your piano by yourself. Give a try.. this is the one you are looking for.,4
"This seems almost perfect for me. Using the """"voice call stream"""" it interrupts the radio (Ford Sync) as a hands free call and reads the text/message  so no missing them when I am not listening to the """"aux"""" mode of the radio where the """"music stream"""" is usually heard. The only problem I have is that the """"call"""" sometimes does not end after reading the message. I have to manually """"hang up"""" (not the end of the world!). Great app though. Thank you.",4

Good but need to be more New style,4
Lit,4
Helpful Kinda helpful at giving you info of most things that happens to your phone battery wise. It had helped determine what is cause of some drains etc. Although this app could use some ui improvement and better redesign layout. Otherwise it's core function it's helpful. Thanks,4
Great but.. Would be awesome if you could add an icon on the main screen indicating the number of sms I didn't read.,4

My main SIP app  light  efficient but very few updates,4
I liked it over all but i wish you had a ps2 emulator built for andriod since the games for this are iso and ps2 emulators for pc use iso it cant be to hard to make a port for android and it would open up an even wider customer base and you could charge more than 6 bucks for a good ps2mobile emulator because while the game selection for the emulators isnt your problem it blows hard for psp port its so much better for ps2 port there just isnt a port for your mobile device you built the best psp port for andriod plz build the best ps2 port,4
The only thing I miss is fingerprint reading. It would be perfect if it supported that.,4
These many no. Of updates from the last 8 months and not the problem of having a security as been completed. Try adding that one too. The app would be a lot more awesome.,4
?? OVERALL MATERIAL DESIGN IS ALL DONE & WE NEED MORE FEATURES SO ITS CAN BE USELMFULL FOR DAUILY BASICS...BT THANKS DEV 4 DEVELOPING THIS,4

This is very important file,4
Fantastic app! Great app and I have been using it for years. I first got it when I had an iPhone and iPad and it was great and I have continued using it now that I have a Samsung phone and tablet. I like that I can transfer the password file between devices however that method is a bit clunky. I think a better option would be to sync files more easily over a local network without going over the Internet. I realize that the file is encrypted but i would like to keep it from going over the Internet at large.,4

Needs new music ya,4
Just a little more features needed ? I'll give it a 5 star if the CAMERA and DOWNLOAD (and maybe SCREENSHOT) folders are at the top (high priority always) of the view list. In addition  would like to at least have the CROP/ROTATE/MOVE and as well as SET AS (Wallpaper  Contact Photo  WhatsApp Profile Picture) features. I know this might increase the overall app file size but these are what most would seek for as basics. We don't need hardcore editing features coz nobody even uses the inbuilt gallery's editor but just need what I mentioned above,4
It's very useful.,4
Works well on some apps When I tried it on some apps it will come. When I tried it on clash of clans and tried to open it it says no network connection.,4

Organise If i have 3 groups test1  test2 and test3  I'd like the option to drag and rearrange the order. Handy when learning a language. I.e a group for present verb  a group for past  a group for different colours and then i add the future tense of a verb. Would be nice to rearrange with a dragging option to make it visually appealing as I learn. Otherwise it becomes cluttered,4

Great app but has some issues Works great on my Nexus 6 except that it gets bugged to where it will only load exactly 5.94 seconds of any song.

Very fun Perfect game for a phone. What better game for a touchscreen than a rougelike? Very addicting  has that one more playthrough kind of game play. Like most rougelikes  it's unbelievably unforgiving  if you get greedy and want that loot that's in the skeleton  get ready to die. Run into a wraith level 2? Goodbye. All they ask is donations  no IAP that I've seen. Can be frustrating  but if you don't want to be frustrated  find a different genre. It's a little hard to pickup  could use a tutorial.,4
Cool and free. I think therefore I am.,4

Great app! Intuitive and a must have app if you have a rooted phone. However  I've discovered an issue while I was playing with the profiles and Tasker. If one profile has a minimum CPU frequency of 600 and another has a minimum of 200  Tasker manages to switch between profiles successfully  but during several switch overs the frequency will stay with the minimum limit at 600. Changing it to 200 can be done only manually.,4

Love it. Use this and minisub on chrome to stream my collection  always reliable and keeps track of recently added albums. Random option is great as well although I feel the the algorithm needs to be tweaked a bit because I see repeated albums in a 6k+ album collection.,4
Very good client I was hesitant to pay for an app that did not know that would suit my needs in the first place. Well  after I set my Owncloud on a rpi and downloaded this app on my Android phone  everything works like a charm. My photos now are getting backed up automatically. If only there was an option to delete original files from phone after having been backed up.,4

Almost perfect This is really a 5 star app  but I want it to play from cloud storage to be perfect. This would make managing songs better since it's easier to discover on a desktop vs mobile. Even better if it could tie to Mod Archive  etc.,4

Does its job. The app functions well. The icon on the homescreen is low resolution  however. So 4 stars as not perfect.,4
It works well This is a great app that will read all of your epubs. The only reason that I gave it one less star is because the app has issues displaying footnotes. It will show that the book contains footnotes  but the link hasn't been opening (at least for me). Otherwise  its a great app!,4
Its okie,4
Liked it Awesome app,4
Good app overall but as of recently i cannot use it  every time i try to update a series it asks me to update my MAL password that i never changed in the first place. Each time i enter the password it doesn't update the series and keeps asking me to do it again. Tried changing the password on MAL also did nothing  don't know what to do.,4
Great app and works really well  the only addition I would appreciate is the ability to search a track and then play it immediately (or queue it so you can skip straight to it) rather than just adding it to the playlist.,4
OK. But improve on it.... Delete button is not accessible,4
The app itself is just great. But every now and then it shows in my contact list people I have long deleted from my contact list. Including a fella I deleted and blocked when I still used another phone and another number. I don't know where the app gets these ghost numbers  but it's creepy as f***  and I don't like the idea of my number (and name) showing up on contacts of people who has deleted my number.

A really cool app This is by far the best lock screen app with notification that i have ever used.. keep up the good work.. but just one more thing.. if you can actually have a function to lock like password and pattern locks  that would be amazing... then i will give you another star..,4
Problems seem to be resolved! I loved and used this app for years  but it developed bugs that were not fixed. Almost gave up but in the last few days the new version seems to have resolved them. Would encourage you to give it a try!,4

Good I download like 5 of these apps and this was the only one to work yes it is a little slow but that's better then not working at all,4
Very easy This app is very simple. It is not like the other apps that are super complex and you do not even know where the settings are.,4
Good Good one,4

Having some problems Work about a few days now when I open up orbot it will load fully and says 100% but when I open orfox to check my connection it doesn't load and says problem with the proxy. Also when I look in the notifications bar orbot doesn't show any addresses it just shows 0kbps/0kbps. I really like orbot but I can't use it at all  and because orbot is acting up u can't use orfox. I'm not sure if there is something I'm doing wrong on my side. Is there anyway someone could help me? I would greatly appreciate it.,4
GrewAl Grewal,4
Good,4
it's ok works well when it works. stops working every time I perform a memory boost. have to either reboot or toggle off the app in accessibility then on again to make it work  very annoying. I find no other of my background apps stop working after a memory boost.,4
more specific options that Chrome makes available would be helpful ie: translation of foreign language sites and a browsing history archive are two things I miss!,4
Android L issues Unable to install OI Safe if OI Notepad is already installed. If I uninstall Notepad I'm able to install Safe  but then I'm not able to install Notepad. This may be because of the new security settings in Android L. Kindly fix before the final version of Android L is released.,4
Awesome Its really awesome!!!!!,4

Great piece Great software and very minimalistic. But recently it has been crashing a lot. Hope to see an update.,4

The feature is superb  handy but app consumes a lot of power even when not in use...please do something to reduce battery consumption atleast when phone is idle.,4
Nice  but crashes when I open messages Nexus 6p Android 7.1.1,4
It nice and good,4
Fully functional and easy to use,4
Grinder RPG A real grinder of an rpg without enough low levels. Also lack of warping / quick home returbs yields high dungeon & trail death rates.,4
Could not install the app,4
It's nice Think it's a great idea!!,4
No backup whatsapp plz tell how it possiable,4
Nida Uroojniaz,4
Nice Works perfectly,4
Nice but i would love my own background. And another issue is that there is no security features like a pattern unlock. Other than that really good work,4
Good  but one major problem The widget part of the app barely works. Usually the podcast I was listening to doesn't show up  so I have to just click on it to access the podcast from within the main app. Or it shows the podcast I was listening to  but when I click the play button nothing happens. Otherwise a wonderful app.,4
For some reason  application icon not displayed in lockscreen (when there's notification)...,4
It's good,4
Great app for figuring out what is eating your battery,4
please add feature to enable encrypted chat by default for all chats,4
Why Why send that clips was corrupted  I can not see  not the one who sent him  was white,4
Liked it,4
am experiencing a problem of updating my Google play store .whenever I try updating it. It just fails I need some help,4
Good Good most of the time  but can be a bit hit and miss.,4
Love this app,4
"A little laggy  and a patch for those who have the """"google play services has stopped working' popup would do good. :)",4
Very good,4
Tittal,4
Absolutely love it. I'm so in love with the idea & execution of this app. However the double tap gesture (to view the artwork in details) is slowing my screen locking speed (since my phone's default screen lock gesture is double tap). Can this be changed to a long press or something else  please? Anyway  great job!,4
Copy and paste Pls add copy and paste option . I love it. And it's must like by all hackers,4
Thanks,4
Nice app,4
Easy to use. Great features.,4
Nice! Love it more if I could display the date too!,4
Ok,4
liked,4
Great app  but... After last 2 update  I can't pinch zoom in and out? It is difficult to read without this functionality because I have reading glasses and sometimes I reply on big text to quickly read without glasses. Secondly  why the attachments are down there now? It used to be beginning of msg. Now have to go all the way down to see. Unnecessary waste of minutes. Please correct both.,4
Best search engine  it need an ad blocker plugin like ghostery to be 5 stars,4

Great,4
Liked it,4
Even though the app is the clone of WhatsApp what i liked was that it is very smooth and clean i haven't faced any bug yet it would be great if you could add voice message function. I hope it will remain free and adfree.,4
Wow an update! I loved this app but it hadn't been updated and so long it didn't work anymore. Thanks for the update I'll see how it works on Android 6.0. If it's like it use to be I'll give 5 stars.,4
In this new update  full screen image zooming is not good. I like the previous zooming which was 2 step zooming in. At least try to increase the zooming% in this newly added update.,4
Good app but no longer seems to sync Have been using this for several months and it is good to keep track of books especially when trying to remember which of a series/which books by author you already had. I used the sync to goodreads as a backup but it doesnt seem to sync at the moment  was hoping to keep in sync between my phone & tablet via goodreads sync but no joy,4
This is a great news reader  clean and uncluttered. Unfortunately some previously-working feeds are now stubbornly refusing to display full-text  e.g. New Scientist  Science Daily. If you could find a way around that  then five stars without a doubt.,4
Good It's okay,4
Powerful app to create and manage blog on mobile devices,4
I want this messenger .,4
Just wish I could see all of it I love the app and the updated pictures from reddit. I just hate that it forces you to see just part of the picture and not the whole thing. Fix that and it would be all 5 stars.,4
Good,4
Great app  takes a while to restore backup tho I've been using this app ever since I got my phone  and it's doing a great job. I use this before updating the ROM in my phone to preserve memories. One downside to using this is the performance of restoring backups. I have around 11k messages and restoring takes a couple of hours. I'm pretty sure it's not my internet connection  because it's the only thing running in my home and it only uses a small bandwidth. I'd rate this 5 stars if it's faster  heck I might even donate,4
Nice app specially the Tasker integration but there is a minor bug I guess making This app sometimes to block every app or maybe it's the my network anyway  awesome 😉,4
My hungry shark world not open correctly but when I update it. It run correctly,4
Mr. Rameshkhurmi V good,4
Cool one,4
working perfectly but notifications/unread msg counts not appearing for whatapp etc on home screen icons.,4
Gives great information about battery stats to let you see exactly what's happening. My only wish is that there could be a flashable zip for when roms are updated. Getting the app back after I update my cm nightly can be a bit tedious. Besides that  fantastic!,4
Needs tabs I really like this app. The format makes it easy to see my searches I wish they had an option to do different tabs however. I have to exit out of my current place in order to search up something else.,4
Thanks,4
well except ugly appearance,4
It's quick & accurate,4
normal,4
Please make it faster because I m trying to play pokemon and it is SO SLOW I can barely do anything just because of the speed  I really like it but the speed makes it bad. Maybe is my Samsung galaxy tab 4 (or something but the tab 4) that can't handle it or something but apart from that it is good,4
Good Nice,4
Very simple and small app without ads....like it,4

Creo que es la aplicación perfecta para mensajería lo único que le falta es poder ver si esa persona ya leyó el mensaje o si no lo ha leído  agregan eso y 5 estrellas porque es perfecta de verdad,4

Good app and useful,4
Aku suka,4

Google,4
Good app,4
Lenovo Happened,4
Almost there. Still fiddly when handling root requests from certain apps  ie. V4A  AdAway  etc but all in all amazing root manager app. Feels more lightweight than Chainfire's.,4
please remove the automatic blur tool. It is only when I do blur,4
It's appears to address the issue.,4
Sharing This app is fantastic. Easy to use  and organises everything automatically  the way I would have anyway. One function I would really love to have though  is the ability to share or sync the information between my tablet and my phone - even if it were a pay to upgrade  would be totally worth it.,4
Useful,4
Great app Very useful and reliable. I've been using it for years. It's one of those apps that's easily taken for granted -- until you get a new phone  then it's one of the first ones you hunt down in the Play Store.,4
"Reliable Does what I need it to do: call recent numbers. The address book lookup is painful and nearly impossible to use. Previously I had a problem with the phone """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""randomly"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" swapping between speaker and headset; that turned out to be toggled by wrist shaking and I turned that setting off.""""",4
Great app. If you like Facebook messenger  then then you will love this app also. All the benefits and the best one is it isn't tied to Facebook. I only wish it would be able to access my Google photos to be able to send photos from there also. It doesn't replace your texting app. It is a stand alone app messenging. Exactly what I was looking for. The perfect Facebook messenger app replacement. Also it works simultaneously across all devices if logged into the same account. Again  only thing it is missing is access to google photos which could allow more photos to be shared within this app and you wouldn't have to have all photos locally stored on the device.,4
For the OS Geek If you need to monitor you system and understand what is being presented to you. This is a good tool to have. One you need to install when you first get your android product  not after you start having issues.,4
Please provide video call and reading notification.,4
Would be nice if I could select it as the default app for opening media files but it doesn't show as one of the options.,4
It's a good app to use,4
No idea how to get roms How do you get Roms on this,4
Good Accurate,4
Good app  but now there is no spell check for english. Only after latest update,4

Have not try it yet,4
Sohail Nice,4
Fun rpg Many hours of play. Waiting for next update! ...understand it takes time  but still waiting.,4
It's a great app and does its job  and I love that it has a tasker plugin. The only thing I do not like is that sometimes all apps dont have internet at all so I need to refresh manually or turn off and on again. But that is not too frequent so I am not annoyed about it that much. I love the profiles and the tasker plugin. Added to mg recommended apps foe privacy on android guide. Thank you so much.,4
Love it but Love my ever changing wallpapers. But can't seem to figure out how to centre the image if I've only got one home screen. I end up seeing just the left side of all my images.,4
Fine,4
Uhhh,4
Nice,4
Please add the ability to add playlist.,4

Please add commands like 'read more'   'color' etc to the app also. Currently its available only on web version.,4
Youtube …,4
Excellent,4
It's a good app the only problem i have is that the chat jumps to the bottom whenever someone sends something. So I will be reading through messages trying to catch up on a conversation and every time someone types something i lose my place. Other than that  it's great.,4
Double tap doesn't work on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5,4

Amazong Amazong,4
Great app! Love it!,4
Do as promised without annoying you Get folders usage in your partitions,4
Suggestion I really love the app but there is one thing i feel should be there so as to make it a preferred choice among the people which is the option to export chats. Please consider the idea,4
Draining my battery...,4
Very good,4
A little issue I'd give it 5 star but if I had to refresh or click the app to read a message or waiting for a chat so that it will appear  I could just use an email.,4
Very functional ...bravo 👌👏,4
Its good but.. Just a bit slow,4
Balanced routes are fantastic This is a brilliant cycling app. I kept getting lost in the back streets of London in trying to avoid main roads or link up the London cycle routes. This has made it so much easier to avoid hotspots like elephant & castle. Only gripe  I wish the live ride wasn't locked to portrait orientation. I'd find it useful in landscape most times.,4

Add automatic download pictures   videos and sounds for specific groups and channels .,4
Great game I am really enjoying this rpg. Plenty of quest  the enemies are challenging  the storyline is engaging. My only complaint would be u miss quite a bit when attacking and when u lose u lose a lot of experience. Buying items to increase ur attack chance seems to help. This maybe the one rpg I play to completion.,4
Hotspots,4
excellent Nice one,4
It's working  but has ugly bug which scrolls the app settings screen up while I try to click 'notify about app connection attempt' which i also observed in other app (banking  but poor). Also I would expect a free fully functional app just with ads (not annoying) from Marcel. UI is not nice. No multiple changing options. Review changed after reading some things... Now just waiting for more free features  then I'll make it 5 stars.,4
Not sure,4
Great app Very helpfull when on the run,4

Awesome until the update. I had made it to Atlantis with Indy and then the Upgrade of Doom happened and it no longer works! Please can you fix this for the latest version?,4
For an alpha release the game is very playable Just upgraded from note 3 to note 4 octa the emu works even better now tried replaying resident evil code Veronica and i got no reboots now and no fps drops at all although a cheat engine would be awesome and saving on the spot will try more games in the near future.,4

Solid Great app to see what apps are using the most battery.,4
Nice 😌,4
"An entertaining and slightly responsive application that gets lagged every now and then. Whenever I play Angry Birds  it becomes almost impossible to avoid noticing certain levels  mainly those that take a great deal of RAM to run  slow down. And since you are aware of the problems GTA encounters--a game which consumes a slightly large part of the phone's GPU--are you actually able to take action to remove that phrase """"slow on mobile""""? I am using a Samsung Galaxy S III running Android Ver. 4.1.2 with a storage capacity of 16 GB.",4

Gud Always need,4
Simple and cool Would be better with a character not naked with a huge belly :),4
I want to feel secure about my data,4
This app is almost perfect. Though I would have 2 suggestions/requests: 1. The ability it add an image to use as album art. The automatic artwork is about 90% successful  it would be great to be able to easily add missing artwork simply. 2. Add an option to send a user saved SSH command to the source device. For example to be able to send a #sudo shutdown now# command to my Raspberry Pi running Runeaudio would be amazing. Aesthetically I prefer this app but I will have to (reluctantly) keep using the Runeaudio app as it has the shutdown command built in. However  despite the above  this app is way better than all the alternatives I've tried. I hope this is still in development. Please keep up the great work.,4
"Great Apps but... The apps description mention support for Android 4.4 but all of mine and friends devices running Android 4.4.2 can't use the lock screen widget feature because no """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""enable widgets"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option in security setting.

Is it still being supported? Last update was almost 2 years ago. Is it still being worked on? Would be a shame if it's abandoned. The emulator itself is pretty good. Runs fine on my S6 Edge. Some glitches here and there. Functions are barebone right now. Would be nice if it's kept working on.,4

Gmail? Doesn't work with Gmail anymore. please fix,4
Does a great job Dimming works fine. Although I have to pause it sometimes as Android doesn't allow overlays to click through for Install and Allow / Deny permission buttons. There's however a problem with Marshmallow update - the dimmer just keeps on getting killed randomly and then it appears back randomly.,4
Better than most Overall its pretty good. I have found 95% of the songs I looked for.,4
Lol,4
Good Like,4
Annoying Notification Notification keeps popping up even after updating the app..,4

Excellent. At one go the details are cleared.,4

Always keeping up on issues and putting out updates!! You guys are on top for a reason!! Thank you Team!!,4
ok,4
You this app super,4
Easy handle,4
Great podcatcher It's free  fairly easy to use and feature rich. One star off for occasional bugs  like playing the first few seconds of a podcast before skipping to the next track for no particular reason.,4

Connecting issues The app is perfect the only issue is when shut down the raspberry and then restart it the app just try to connect to it. The problem is that the raspberry changes its ip and the app can't find it. A solution it came to my mind is that the app don't search the raspberry with its ip but with its name. The only bad thing with this is that someone may have to raspberry with the same name but this is his problem. Sorry for my bad English. I wish I helped.,4

Useful app,4
acually worked so yea 4 stars because you type a name of a song and it's too long so yea,4
A simple to use app that lets you save to device. The main issue is that if I don't close the app fully it stays on the same date for days. An example... If I open the calendar on the 1st of the month and come back to check the date on the 5th of the month it still shows the date as the 1st. At this point I have to shut down the calendar app and open it again.,4
Good Very nice,4
It is very fine app All is well It s O/K,4

The best wallpaper app Love it. It is the first app I install on my phone and keeps pulling stunning wallpapers each time paired with 500px plugin,4
Excellent app but supports only mp4 videos Nice concept with mini size and simple display of videos and photos. But shows only .mp4 format videos. No .flv format! Why? All else is excellent! Good job  devs!,4

Love it Though I still run into the occasional buffering issue when I'm using mobile data instead of WiFi.,4
Dark mode Finally added a dark theme. Thanks,4
One of my favorite sources. .. I've listened to npr on the radio for years now and why I didn't get the app sooner I will never know.,4
Needs work Simple to get going needs to be able to change disk... save state like n64oid and run code veronica properly as it's my favourite!!!,4
Good Beautify mode should be added...,4
Frustrated I took away a star because their have been no updates for 2 yrs!,4
Its really nice aap,4
Just one thing missing Overall I really like this app. It's functional and quite fast. I love the customizable stickers thing and the possibility to search and send gif in-app  BUT! I really feel that some essential emoji are missing. Please add an alpaca  Doge  swan  llama and the geeky colourful stuff. They are really needed. Sending much love guys. Please send back needed emoji,4
great,4
Great app! Adding podcast subscriptions is a little clunky but other than that this app is great.,4
N ok,4
"Used to be great but now it seems every single time I boot the phone the firewall doesn't actually get applied so ALL internet access is blocked unless I manually open the app and """"""""""""""""apply"""""""""""""""" the settings. If I forget to do this I can go half the day and be missing emails and messages because the phone is locked down.

Hi Heloo,4
Good but not best....,4
Nice app! Good app!,4
Super Super,4
Love it  just not feature-packed This is the closest thing to what I've been searching for and works extremely well on my Samsung S5  but some shortcuts don't work and are instead added to the home screen of the primary default launcher. It would be perfect if I could choose where (vertically and horizontally) the window appeared on the screen. It would also be great to have the option of pages you can swipe left and right through. The aim with these features would be reachability on the screen.,4
Google,4
Nice! Very nice app for cataloging  I wish I could see other review and notes for each book and share mine though.,4
Good ver,4

I have no problem when it comes to the phone side of things but the Android wear watch face can be a little better. As in more customization to the actual clock face.,4
Nice application for the use of the day,4
But not sure this is a good app,4
Last update 6th Feb won't open now  lost all my data - uninstalled Updated again now works fine all data back from back up thank you,4
Lol,4
Great and Informative I use this all the time to look up armors and items  and it has yet to be wrong with anything. My only peeve is that every time I exit the app I end up back at the main screen  so I kinda wish it would let me puck up from where I left off. Highly recommended nonetheless!,4
"Not bad Obviously not as good as Yatse  bit it can do well by offering all the essential features. Let this be the core """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Official""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""app and Yatse the hacker's app. First thing it really needs is a tablet layout.""""",4
Good idea but not getting what i want Great app diffently going to use it however  please add a way where i can have the extensions on both sides of the clock. Right now i can have three on right side of the clock if im using a 5x2 grid. I know i can extend it but my home screen looks weird with that extended. I want to have my missed calls etc etc on one side and battery  weather and other info on the other. Other then that what a simple app but it maybe too simple where we loose alot of customizable options.,4
Good,4
Verry nice.,4

Goood Very nice app,4
Original but not so perfect. Great time killer that is fun and totally offline! Easy to pick up and play but difficult to master since it requires abit of planning and LARGE amount of luck. Degradation on weapons is seriously not fun since it adds unnecessary worry on top of the contant hunger status. Fun nonetheless but a bit too much RNG can be bad. Shattered Pixel Dungeon is much more fair in comparison.,4
No calling feature!! All other features are amazing  except for the fact that I can't call  not even voice call.. 😭,4
Useful,4
It's great BUT I use a Moto X Play  and there persist some bugs. 1. After taking a pic  it lags. 2. Please give an option in which we can use flash whenever we want  like I found 2 options  taking pics without flash  and auto-flash. It doesn't store pic in camera roll  even when you select the option manually. 4. It doesn't display the pic taken  rather it displays the last pic in camera roll. Hoping for those bug fixes soon  thanks in advance! :),4

I like the app. I like to play the games.,4
Useful I love the simplicity  but I wish there was a pin lock for it.,4
The Best So Far,4
Keeps turning itself ON I appreciate this free program  thanks for making it available. I just wish it would stop turning itself on. I will pick up my phone after it has been sitting for a few hours and find Orbot running again. Guess I'll try uninstalling and reinstalling... Galaxy S5.,4
Tanks,4
Bonzer app Love it. Easy to use and configure. Almost five stars but needs notifications of new podcasts to work with Android system notifications.,4
Very nice app. But can u make it more user-friendly for Moto users by enabling full screen reading mode. Today the mute button at the bottom (even when screen is rotated) & name of the channel with too much width consumes a lot of space. Further for Moto G4 plus  the upper strip of battery n clock + bottom strip of virtual buttons remains as it is. Hence plz make updates to enable full screen mode. I have a lot of useful data to read on it.,4
Pin lock Developer u should include pin lock security......,4
Works great every time I need it to work.,4
Great camera but I'm missing the ability to set the light temperature in kelvins which coming from Samsung camera app I miss very much as I use calibrated studio lighting. Otherwise 5 stars.,4
"quite good  with a number of options. Best of all  are hardly any permission needed! however  it doesn't play .ogg files - from the 'Files' tab  when i select the file  there is a pop-up saying """"0 files playing"""" and nothing is played. so far i've tried mp3 and aac and both works. Xiaomi Mi3  KK4.4.4 miui 6.",4
Nice app,4
Hmmm Fantastic experience,4
why it can't auto backup? it can't auto backup sms and phone call log,4
Best so far! Just a suggestion. If the Up and Down Arrow buttons were given at the bottom only  it'd be easier to operate in long screen phones.,4
Awesome!!!!,4
It's super great I especially love I can pull my phone outta my pocket and see my notifications. It would be so much greater if I could see all my notifications though  I don't see my messenger notifications nor my Snapchats which is really annoying seeing as those are my main notifications. Would give five as soon as this is fixed.,4

T.V. Entertainment,4
Nice appd I am always say thx to Google.,4
Good app but Auto Backup doesn't work (the app is not installed on SD card BTW). Works well doing a manual backup though.,4
Works great. Treesize for your phone. Only trouble is a lack of a full file name pop out without switching to software renderer.,4
Kinda jerky on my Note 4. tried restarts  recalibration  dampening  sensor speed. Nothing helped. Fix for 5.,4
Settings menu Has always worked great  with some random crashes but they aren't frequent enough to be too troublesome. I am now having the issue that the settings menu will no longer pop up  which is rather essential. Hoping this is soon fixed. If not it'd be 5 stars,4
Practically Perfect The only thing I find really lacking are the colour/theme variations. If it were possible to chose a custom colour (via colour wheel) for the time and extension fonts it would definitely get 5 stars. The black and white are nice but as my lock screen wallpaper changes with each lock/rotation I often have trouble seeing the white on light backgrounds or the black on certain dark ones. Though It's not annoying enough for me to look for a different app.,4
Informative app,4
Good Very useful app,4
It improves a lot compared to its older version. And the songs is up to date.,4
Good for scroblers For the people that want to continue scrobbling after all these years. Wish it would pull tracks that don't broadcast and just take track info from notification of what is playing so apps like YouTube Music and Bandcamp would work.,4
Its a great app,4
Almost perfect! Simple yet versatile! If only there was a drag & drop option to rearrange the app icons. Pinning the app and changing the order with 'Pinned app sorting' option is all good and stuff  however it would be much more easier to have a drag & drop option. Also  it'll be great to have all apps listed in Hangar rather than limiting them to the ones that is frequently used. Divider is a bit rectangle-ish  a more square design will make it look more presentable.,4
Useful It's really cool and useful... but when playing Mario and Luigi partners in time i cant hit the start button without it crashing so i cant progress through the game. I dont know if its your app or the rom. But if it is the app PLEZ FIX,4
Great app Good app but could you add option for audio path? Forces output though bluetooth headset rather than external speaker.,4
Ok,4
Great,4
it is good . but can be improved like a bit slow now and also few things can be added like highlight the texts in offline mode etc.,4
Awesome But I can't find some music that I search so I'm giving 4/5 stars,4
Good game I love-love-love-love-love-love-love-love- loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
Almost Perfect I really like this app and I have had it for quite some time but around 1/3 of the music I really want downloaded isn't really available.,4
i'd like to think that an easier way could be worked out  but the app does work as described. How many steps there are to complete the setup would be good information up front. For me  the first two codes too about 10 minutes to arrive. since I was expecting them immediately  I did the 3rd one  which worked. The one issue that I have is how to get to the message then back to the screen where it should be entered. I did it  but it was quite clumsy. It would be great if the code could show itself on the page that's already there. There are a couple of weak spots in either my understanding of how it's done or the coder's planning  but this is a well working app.,4
Great job with the app. Only question is if there is a setting to enable gapless playback? I lose maybe 2 seconds of audio after each track. Not annoying with books that contain a lot of tracks,4
Almost perfect. One of the best camera app. May be you just need a simplified UI to be perfectly perfect.,4
Great Aside for a few bugs  I love this app!,4
Hmmmmmmmmmmm 😊,4
Nice Hi am avin a prblm wif dis app Its not updating,4
Good,4
Fantastic and simple app that does what it should: wake you up Love the app! And have been using it for years and years! However  with the new update  I'm experiencing that my alarms are soundless when my phone are on mute  which it is pretty much all the time  Which again makes it a little bit useless for me right now at the moment but hopefully there will be a fix,4
Best Camera I like the app and i like the TIME STAMP on it but my problem is I cannot change the save location of my taken photos. I cannot save it to my micro sd card. Can you help me?,4
some of the puzzles are a little confusing,4
It good  but I really miss ability to make a search in app  but open results in a browser.,4

Have to lower one star Recently the app doesn't turn off the wifi setting and leave wifi on the entire time whenever I go far from my home. Please fix this bug for me ASAP.,4
Good,4
Love it This app is so amazing and modern! But can u guys PLEASE add a lock screen!?,4
I always download this app when I need to edit ringtones  because A) it has been around  almost unchanged  since the early days of Android and B) it does exactly what I need it to do  perfectly.,4

Nicely done extension Would be even more amazing if the app opens the notification of the app instead of opening the app. Because of how the extension currently works  Tapatalk doesn't work :(,4
Very good,4
Great except for enter key during texting Everything is great except that the enter key during texting doesn't make a new line. Instead  it sends the texts that are often unfinished. My hand accidentally presses it while texting and it sends a lot of unfinished messages. Super frustrating. Please make an option to turn that off.,4
Thank you so much So my Moto G4 play had no inbuilt gallery app. And I wanted an app that would let me move photos from an album without going to the file explorer. And I went through lots of gallery apps before this one. And the customisation of the app is an added coolness.,4
Good  but needs some work A little slow. When I tried to open an unedited picture with this app it hung up searching for something  even though there was nothing there to find.,4
Unqqq,4
Needs a couple more features to be perfect. Please add the ability to skip forward and backwards by n seconds. Also  after a pause or exit  play back n seconds from the last pause. Other than that  great app!,4
Great app but This is amazing for a free app but it kills auto rotate in all apps on my LG G4 which makes viewing landscape pics a pain. I put up with it because the rest of it is so good. Perhaps they will fix it in the next update  I do hope so.,4
It would be good if google could run without this app.,4
Used website never knew there was app I used the website few months back when the council took away all the recycling skips in the car park for the 2 high rise flats. I complained every week direct and no help. I put it on here and suddenly the council decided to put 4 blue and 4 black wheelie bins back... Not that that's enough over 450 people but it's something and people are recycling again,4
Really good As GM this app helps out for quick references for feats as well quick information and rulings,4
Glitchy zoom is very fickle  on screen rotations it loses zoom and the resume option is too zoomed in. sometimes freezes when zooming. previous versions were fine. don't fix what isn't broken.,4
1) Please provide personalized recommendations. 2)option for printing 3) offline reading option,4
fine,4
Never seen some of these puzzles Great crossword app.....but I don't get half of the crossword puzzles that are shown on this page..... Never seen Boston Globe for instance. Give me more daily puzzles please!,4

Good Thank you for developing this app,4
Voice and video call Good app  but don't have voice call and video call  so 4 stars.,4
Excellent for trolling people on Google + thanks! Now I can make emos cry thanks to this app! =D,4
It works  you can download music. Very hit or miss though and it seems to me that whenever I look for current or widely popular content  is when it misses most. Then when it recommends downloading the plus version of the app  it's about getting paid. I can understand that  the people that created and maintain this app would like to get paid for their efforts. Guess it now depends on how much it will cost....,4
Nice,4
Won't focus camera Won't focus camera on Nexus 6P. Fixed by clearing data and cache. Weird.,4
Close to perfection  Sonic's eyes in SA1 need work  Controller camera was a pain to configure  the King Boom Boo boss in SA2 is nearly impossible because no shadows are Emulated and I wish Save Slots or multitasking was available. Otherwise  go for it! You'll love it!,4

Getting there almost perfect Only problem is it only works in pocket mode. ( it displays my glance screen once I pull the phone out of pocket) and not always on . Anyways battery is not effected much and I like the way simple notifications are handled. Could be the best AOD in future to replace stock S7,4
Its a good and useful app esp in managing groups chat. Its done better than whatsapp honestly in that term. One think that could be added in the next update for better performance is the star/bookmark feature. It ll help a lot if we want to revisit the important posts later. Btw the date and remember scroll position are good ones. But still it could be better with the star/bookmark feature.,4
Best one I have tried New to rooting (2nd phone) and learning about Linux. Don't know a lot of technical things (always been a windows guy) but this gave me power and did it trouble free. Helps me to learn the workings of Linux based android.,4
Nice Nice app but not runing game fast...my mobile samsung grand prime...,4
Easy to Use I loved it once I got accustomed to it but a major improvement would allow users to enter in old data (from pen/paper) when one has an older car. The biggest issue for me is I got a new phone and lost all the data entered. My Honda is 12 years old and now I have a six month or more gap in my record keeping. So I am looking for a different app that syncs with all my devices. I am not going to convert to an excel file!,4

Requested feature. First of all I love your app. I would love if you could integrate a deck builder. I have to use another app for it. If that was made 5 stars for sure!,4
I have been using other podcast software for years  but my phone died and the old software doesnt exist for my new phone. This app is good  I am still learning to use it  most of my gripes are that it is not just like my old app - the interface metaphor is different. Maybe I will adapt and it will grow on me and I will call it a 5.0 rated app....,4
I like it Is fun and so true to the board game.,4
It says unfortnulatly stopped,4
Interface could be modernised for material design  but gets the job done well.,4
No lock This is a great lock screen  with minimalism at its best. A lockscreen is the only thing that makes it not perfect. Additionally having no lockscreen takes away the name lockscreen.,4
Great App Satisfied with the app. I works really weel,4

I love the game  but i hate the huntress and the lack of saves. The huntress is useless  all the other characters have a special ability by the tome of mastery  so why doesn't she? Also please add bigger levels  more food  4 ring slots instead of 2. Also  i really don't like how when i die and get reborn by Ahnk  i lose all my bags (key ring  seed pouch  scroll holder  wand holster)  but for some reason i get to keep my dew vial? Its useless after the dwarven city anyway ,4

Lockscreen? Love the app just wish I could set it with my lock screen,4
Smashwords App I like the app  alot of free books of great authors but I didn't like the fact that I had to install another app (I chose kindle) to save the books I download to read later on.,4
Great though there are some bugs I really enjoy immerssing in Wikipedia articles  thanks to your magnificent app. Unfortunately sometimes when I open Persian (Farsi) articles I encounter a blank page so I have to swipe all the way to the left to view the article. That's probably because of a layout issue for articles in RTL format. please fix it. Thanks.,4
G700 Please update,4

Constalation Map I love this app  there's so many features to this app that continues to excite me. For example  you can go into the past  & forward to the future to see constalation  plus you can go to a particular date & time. I took a picture one day without knowing there was 3 plants that my camera pick up. I've put the exact location time & date of what planets was in my cellphone picture  That blew my mind to see what planets was in my picture. It'll be educational for children and adults  so get it  NOW.,4
Good It does a good job for the most part. If it works for a bit and stops its most likely that the device's IP has changed. Set up static IP and it should be fine.,4

Great! Missing some features though It works wondefully! My only gripes are the lack of rotation and the paged view having a white background instead of being dark transparent. Other than these  it stays true to Trebuchet ?,4
Tahnx,4
Great app. Does what it should. Would like the ability to cancel a connection attempt. Particularly if you put in an incorrect server. Had to stop the process from the application manager. It doesn't seem to time out. Also the order of the WIFI networks should be active/connected first.,4
Not bad It does what i need it to and provides the info i want.,4
Loving it. Just keep crashing lately  need help,4

Great reader app! I've used FB Reader for a couple years now. It's a great app. I use it in read aloud mode. Works great. The only thing it needs is Drop Box access. I will raise my rating up to 5 stars once they add Drop Box.,4

Cleanest and Simplest Lock Screen but... Hands down one of the best cleanest and simplest lock screens out there. But it needs a security option (ex. PIN unlock or PASSWORD). Hopefully that feature would be added in.,4

I really like using this app  but you need to add the ability to rearrange the tiles. I want to move my most used tile to the top  but I can't. They appear in the order that you add them and that's it.,4
I really love it but... Can't play monster hunter 3rd portable English crack 😞,4
Best of the rest! I've been using FBReader for almost 2 years now and it never once let me down. But there is a recent hiccup on my new phone. The page turn (curl) animation is laggy and not smooth at all. My phone is a decent one and it plays high end games like a charm so performance shouldn't be an issue. Please fix this for me or if possible let me know of any possible fix for this. Cheers.,4
useful for all,4

Super fantastic My only suggestions would be to explain a bit more what each rythym can do for you or maybe just reference where you can get more information. I find it all a bit confusing. Also I don't know if it's my phone  but the notification saying binaural beats is playing will not go away even when the app is entirely off. Otherwise  great app.,4
Excellent Works excellent  would like to be able to select several sources at once and a random wallpaper picked from them but it's easy to change .,4
By me sumthng pls!! Whu i am?,4
So far so good..,4
Great  but needs more Thanks! Please add the media/files permission  I'm getting access denied when I try to access /storage/* /sdcard /mnt/user. I still think some basic color support (red/green/black/white options?) would be good  and that a real menu interface would be better than longpress (menu button support is nice  but most devices don't have one). It would also be nice to have an easy way to change the keyboard--I use hacker keyboard only with terminal apps  and only rarely  so switching is a pain. I'd be happy to pay..,4
Good app,4

Nice as expected. Just for the hell of it  I've been looking for one of these to keep busy. This one is quite nice  but one issue I have is that after about 20 tanks  it asks me for a name  and when I put a name in  it boots me to the home page.,4
Every thing is OK.,4

Pretty good. Sometimes have issues with the photos  but fixable.,4
Good but Some issues in low light photo.There is delay between flash and actual capture resulting in dark snaps. Please rectify the problem.,4
I'm crazy about this. App I've had it before but. Now. Its playing in slow motion. What can I do,4
Despite dying so much  this is a pretty fun game. Would be nice if we could get permanent upgrades after many playthroughs like Desktop Dungeons. Edit: Ok. This game is way too hard. Minus 1 star since I can never get past the 5th floor. Please add an easy mode (which will probably still be more difficult than 99% of RPGs out there).,4
this app made life easy,4

Has a better experience Gives more fun than other messaging apps and is also simple to operate just provide newly updates every month to enjoy it more,4
I like it,4
Useful apps for review any documents,4
It is great,4
I really loved this app for so long. I had over 900 books entered into it and loved that I could check them off as I read them and create my own biokshelves. However  I backed all of my archives up into my sd card because I had to factory reset my phone  and poof. Everything is gone.,4

Like the app. Best app I can find that allows you to pick your microphone source. Have a slight problem with the exposure it seems to not work sometimes when changing from front facing and selfie camera. If you can update this app it will be perfect and I'm sure a lot of us would agree.keep it up!,4
Worked untill last update App worked great until last update now I don't get any stats won't read any metrics.,4
U need patience to run it. Poor ui. Poor sound. Poor cdi game file searches. Given its free then it's really awesome as hell until you place a dollar on it. When ui customisation and few other things it might be worth a dollar more.,4

Notification does not work Since after the last update  the notification does not work. I have to open the app to see messages. I'm missing on time communication,4
Why doesn't it support wallpaper scrolling? I love having beautiful art changing daily  but I'd rather see more than a third of it without opening the app.,4
its good,4
Excellent Built-in weather not working  please update :),4
'it's okay,4
Great content  & app is improving  but still falling behind NPR has great content  and the app has improved (thanks for the smaller font on my tablet!)  but it still lags behind other news apps. There's no day/night option. I can't download articles/podcasts for offline consumption. I'd use it more if not for these drawbacks.,4
After a quick test I'm pretty sure this will be my main messenger some day. It also has all the features to compete with the big names. Most importantly it's federated through Matrix. Many of the features are non existent or poorly supported in xmpp clients. When End To End encryption is enabled by default it'll get my 5th star.,4
Needs more settings options The suggestion thing is nice but it would be better if we could disable the recently used app suggestions from showing on homescreen as default.,4
Best app,4
Keep the good work,4
Like it,4
Its a trusted aap,4
Problem with volume When you adjust volume outside of the app by using the phone's physical volume button or the popup volume controller  the volume reverts back to the level you set in the app's main window when the next track plays. Please fix,4
It's pretty cool. It's easy to use and downloads songs quickly,4
Upgrade Very nice upgrade,4

Excellent in free apps Easy and simple connectivity other than paid apps. It supports Nexus 7.,4
I like it but We can't add links,4
True to the game The function of the game is consistent with home gameplay. I love the graphics  animations and gamepiece manipulation as well. My only critique or suggestion would be to include device to device multi-player ability. This functionality and user interface is not the easiest or friendliest,4

I will give you epic five stars. Thank you. And also   my soul calibur runs 50-60 fps  for people had a problem because if game performance  try to change The settings or watch from YouTube for best setting for your games.,4
Would be nice if user wouldnt need to set looping all over again for each selected track,4
If it have call message and video it would be the best app in the world,4
It's great 7/5 would recommend,4
Good Good,4
using apps thank you,4
Great app I only use these guides as references due to their HD images they take but many techniques used to pry things apart are less than clean or professional,4
Good messenger application. The Greatness of this app is it works both on desk top and mobile. Could be accessed on any device. Only drawback is there is no Voice and Video calls. Requesting Telegram to introduce these two features fast.,4
Google play,4
Fine It very good,4
Really good app Edit: This app is really helpful in every way. All it would need is a armor set builder/ armor set builder is not working properly on my phone still cool though,4

Great Awsome app with a feature request. Have to ability to get back to stock voltages. When offset is implemented there is no indication to what stock was. Otherwise 5 stars.,4
Great app This is just what i needed. It is very simple to use and practical. The UI could be prettier  though it is certainly functional,4
The app is very good but I want a new design  which is more attractive.,4

Great camera app! Makes my Axon 7's camera shine and I now love the detail and clarity I'm getting. Sadly the stock ZTE app makes pics blurry and over exposed... Thought it was the phone's camera but it was the crappy software the whole time. Only issues with this app is that the auto focus in video mode isn't great at all and the app icon really sucks imo,4
It has lags and bugs,4
Great,4
Does it work for facebook?,4
Super Super,4

It's great  but it won't let me loop commands. It would super helpful if it did  and if it already does and I just don't know how  then sorry.,4

Excellent Feature rich camera takes high quality photos. Love that the app is open source  just as Android was meant to be. This is my goto camera  even better than the OEM camera.,4
Ok Ok,4
it's come a long way. I still don't add or change anything on the cell or tablet. wish syncing were a little easier.,4
Fun and addictive The game is fun and addictive to play to see how far you can get before you die. There is a large amount of luck involved in my opinion due to random item spawn. However  this is part of what makes it so challenging. If you were guaranteed things it wouldn't hold the same amount of interest.,4
Brilliant  apart from searching.,4
Please make it better... add more ability like video call,4
Great! Made it my launcher. Widgets issue doesn't to be related to updates after all so I'm unsure of why I happened several times,4
Like this app But consuming lots of space,4
Very good One small problem: once a playlist is selected and playing...their is no indication which playlist has been selected. Otherwise has evolved to be the best music player and playlist manager.,4
Great stuff  but search fails Nice app with a few annoyances.. The biggest one is that the search function does not find a lot of stuff in the db. I have about 7 artists in there named martin... yet only 3 show up in a search. These artists are shown in the artist list  so they are in the db..... Just not found,4
Awsome game Wish it would be updated so all quests could be completed   and all lands could be explored.,4

Azhar,4
Simple Just like it says  simple. Just what I needed. All music files are found and listed. Nice! But I gave only 4 stars cuz when I try to edit the artist  title  etc in a song the info I change won't save and sometimes the app will crash afterwards. Otherwise  love it!,4
Liked Its liked,4

Nice but could have been better The story is good and quite addictive but it would have been even better with a lil better graphics and better controls and still i found it quite entertaining though,4
Like it Very interesting way of approaching and revealing different ways of therapy.,4
Should add star message feature. It'll be the best messaging app,4
It works Easy to use and dump the junk,4
It works This is the only podcast app I've used and I like it. It does the job and is really straightforward. And now that I have figured out to swipe things out of my queue it's much less cluttered. I would like more browsing possibility when looking for new podcasts but I'm not sure if that's the app or user error,4
Now it is user-friendly (: The developer listened listened and fixed a major issue with Android Marshmallow marshmallow devices. Moreover I claimed that the app is deleting older records. Apparently it just appends all records to one file created on the same day as the recording started. As a default setting  or however I would recommend to create a new file for each recording.,4

Good Nice app i lov it so much,4
My phone Galaxy s7 edge Works fine. Also used in LG proG2. No Adds really cool.,4
Eats lot of ram,4
Vast improvement over stock app Very impressive functionality (angle display  automatic picture rotation  quick access to common features with one hand)! Some minor glitches though: preview screen is corrupted after stopping video capture; pause after taking photo - hard to exit (e.g.  why not use back button?); the settings button(s) are a bit too small for most thumbs. The menu organization is not very intuitive in some places. Continuous focus doesn't seem to work. Speaking of focusing  the stock app refocuses after gentle shaking.,4
It is very nice aap,4
If this integrated with FX file manager  it would be perfect.,4
Good app User friendly app good information,4

This is the best password safe in my opinion. However  two features would make this app even greater. 1) utilize fingerprint for authZ to open password files; 2) Have results from the search display as I'm typing. These two things would only increase the user experience.,4
Awesome Nice,4

Great app and great developer This app is almost perfect for me. The only thing that it's missing is CalDAV support to sync with Thunderbird's Lightning. Hope this is on the cards.,4
It's great it just has a heck of a time trying to process 3D images or whatever you want to call them,4
Good job I think you can copy the customizations from thumb keyboard  like letter spacing and padding and you have done almost everything. In the settings  would you provide any preview of the customization a user will select? At the moment they are just text you have to try and try and try until you see what you need. Ps:we need word themes(lollipop at least).,4

Yes it's vim but needs some improvements Since Android 5.0  I've noticed the overlaying app could use some changes.

Use to love it. First  the GOOD. This app is the best wallpaper changer app that I have found. Cycle multiple images on regular intervals  blur and dim images to help see icons on launcher  rotates images if launcher can support it  and handles images of different sizes. Now the BAD  this app use to show the whole image and would adjust scrolling depending on the image size in landscape but now it won't go to the edges. Also the double tap feature is broken on Smart Launcher. Although I think this is the Launcher's fault.,4
Good If you want to be army,4
This app is great It's easy to use and has a good variety of music.,4
Good love it. Does have some songs and i tried downloading frostwireplus but it wont download. That is ok  it is still the best music downloader.,4
Fun little launcher! Once you get the hang out how to use it and set up some shortcuts  it can be a pretty fast launcher! I really like the novelty of the command line  but I'm beginning to miss widgets.,4
simple but best rounder app. specially paid version works very good.,4
It is very efficient,4
Good app  but limited. It's not a bad app  but it really is just the prd without the tables. If it had the minor books  updated more frequently  was a bit more accessible with racial archetypes and added the tables  it'd get five stars easily.,4

great for searching files this app lacks a few features  1) search in all partitions/filesystems including the system ones. 2) toggle following symbolic links on/off. if these features can be implemented  that'd be great.,4
Sometimes there are keys with no doors  and locked doors with no keys. In these cases  I check everywhere using the search function  eventually starving to death. Not sure if it's a bug  or I'm just being dumb.,4
It is good .But I have a problem with compressing and decompressing files. Please fix it.,4
Daniel HTC One Such an unassuming little app that does so well. Really worth a try. Good feature set (even if it may not have EVERYTHING you want) that's easily accessible  good customisation options  never plays up or hangs on any of my six different devices  and delivers year after year so far. For book worms  this must be pretty close on ideal. Students may want a bit more.,4

I prefer the interface of this app over Smart Wifi Toggler  which I've been using for about a year. I would like to know how to port over the list of existing locations and data from that app to the Wi-Fi Matic app so I can remove Smart Wifi Toggler from my phone and only use this one. Is this possible? A response from the developer on this would be appreciated.,4

Almost perfect Does a great job but when working with GPG it sometimes fails to open the encrypted mail and only displays an unusable file. Sometimes it stays in an endless loop of synchronisation so I have to use the settings to stop the app. Otherwhise perfect,4
B+ Things that could be improved: playlists (queing seasons  adding multiple items)  tablet layout (too small)  no widget or lockscreen controls.. I'd pay/donate for this if it was an option..,4
Good! Really nice I love it so! But i'd like u to add more theme colors. Purple & pink could be boring. Update this and I'll give u 5 stars,4

Can't backup again if we make backup once Hi..... I want to suggest something.... That is when we delete a message log from gmail why it can't make the backup again??? For example I deleted the message log of my friend because his log consists 100 messages but I want only 50 to 60 that were important.... I restored messages  I also deleted that messages from gmail account in sms able and the I deleted 40 messages of my friend when I tried to backup those 60 messages the app can't make backup of them I shows nothing to back up.....,4

Good but would like wma support. Love the app but would like it better if it has wma support since the majority of my music is in that format.,4
Simple Very simple app to use. Only problem with simplicity is there's few options. No way to pick and choose specific podcast episodes you want to download and no way to change the order in which they are played. However if your looking for something simple to listen to automatically download daily or weekly podcasts this works well.,4
Nice app It is very helpful,4
Its better and easy to use,4
BIOS how to Guys guys. Whoever is having problems with reading the BIOS read this. You make the folder yourself and put the BIOS in it. You think you are done but false. When you try to load the BIOS the emulator for some weird reason makes another folder inside the folder you made. Just copy and paste the BIOS into the folder inside the folder. Grats,4
Amazing but one little issue Fast  clean  and lots of features. Only thing is that picture-in-picture for youtube videos doesn't seem to work on my phone (Moto X Pure Edition 2015/Stock Marshmallow/Non-rooted).,4

Excellent app! This is exactly what I needed to display notifications on Nexus 5 lockscreen. Only thing missing is the ability to force the notifications panels to to center align like you can with the clock. Would happily rate 5 stars if that could be done.,4
A few bits missing... So nearly perfect... Hellooooo first big thanks and well done  I would like to see  a way to re arrange my apps on the top I have pinned 5 apps but I dont like the order they appear in. Thank you,4
Good app  will be more effective if the following features are available: 1. Ability to store receipts on our cloud account such as Google Drive thereby saving precious local SD card space. 2.

Very useful its very useful app by backing up our msg and call logs. its interesting to see in our mail box and can we find any saved number for our reference later. but tool should have one more option when it backed up  removed from the mobile the original or it could be a optional paramater if user desires it can enable,4
Nice and clean. I wish switching back and forth between sources and addons  and the remote was easier. Also  a widget with playback and volume controls would be great.,4

I can set it  but it doesn't actually make any sound. That means I have to keep waking up my phone to check how much time I have left.,4

"Dramatic Excellence This critic could not help but smile warmly as soon as Ashton Kutcher's delightful mustache graced the silver screen  and now that he has made his debut there's no doubt in my mind that he was born for this role. The writing alone is enough to bring a tear into the eyes of even the most numerically challeneged of janitors. Kutcher carries this picture into the highest echelon of film- though it may not be a surprise to many  especially after her excellent cinematography in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Kindergarten Cop"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

I don't usually rate apps but when I do you can be sure that that app is worth it. The functioning  the design everything about this app is amazing. I don't even have any suggestings on how to improve it  it's that perfect. I want to thank the developer(s) who made this app. It literally is a life saver. Don't look anywhere else if you need a disc usage analyser  you just found it.,5
It is the best. Unmatchable,5

Does everything what browser should do. When I switch to old tabs it shows weird tiny picture of site -but when I scroll it a bit everything is fine.,5
"Great if you love CLI. It's pretty usable if you're good at typing. There is a decent amount of customization  about as much as you'd need for a basic terninal other than don't type  which would be a nice addition. It's be nice if suggestion font size could be independent of the """"stdout"""" font size  since the suggestions are a bit too small to click for me  but I don't want the output text to be larger. All in all  if you just want a simple launcher  are good with your phones keyboard  and love command line  this is your launcher.",5

One minor minor bug but phenomenal game The game is amazing (still can't make it past level 17 no matter how hard I try) just want to say the developer is great this is the best of the pixel dungeon knock offs  the minor bug is that when you fall into the level below and it sometimes occurs on top of a monster making u have to step away from it get hit then proceed to attack it  like I said minor minor  but it would be nice if you killed it on impact. Addendum: use rogue beat game,5
The best The best messenger out there. Sadly there aren't as many people using this one compared to whatsapp,5
Indispensable! I totally wiped my rooted S4  upgraded to KitKat  and reloaded some of my usual apps when my insane battery drain problem began (again). After reading online about how to use BBS  and then poking around in its many areas for a while  I found my problem. There's no way that I could have figured it out otherwise.,5

"This is probably the most enjoyable game I've played on Android. It is not without its flaws though. It's still under development. It has been for years and in that time it really hasn't progressed much. There are quests you can't finish and roads you can't take with nothing to signify which ones except they don't work. The """"""""""""""""guardian"""""""""""""""" creatures blocking narrow paths quickly become tedious because they're on nearly every single screen. EVERY cave  no matter how big  eventually narrows multiple times to just big enough for two rats or bees or zombies to stand  unmoving  side by side so you have to fight both at once. It gets real old  real quick. Some rewards for boss fights are really  really bad  useless items. Drop rates for the rarest items are ridiculously low at .1% and even .01%. Respawn rates are completely random  meaning a creature blocking a path may respawn right in front of you before you can even move forward after killing it  sometimes more than once. And the story line is severely lacking for a game with so many years of development. In many quests you are forced to choose sides with zero information and the choice you make permanently effects trade and services available. If you're lucky you get some information AFTER you've chosen a side  but even then it's he said  she said every single time with no real explanation. It's all about the reward. You're choosing a side  not to further an exciting story  but as a cheap device to decide which reward you get  which people you can trade with or which services are available. Repeatedly. There is no thinking involved  no weighing of options. You either choose randomly or you look it up to see what you'll get. Horrible quest design. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. A TON of quests in the really crappy areas you hate going through are """"""""""""""""back and forth"""""""""""""""" busy work. But somehow it's still really entertaining  at least for a week or two.""""",5

Great app Worked really well and made my contact list look a lot better... until Facebook broke it  that is. For those seeking an alternative: I suggest Identiconizer. It's not pictures  but it's better than the default icons. It generates blocky patterns based on the contact's name. I installed it via F-Droid  but it's probably available in the Play store  too.,5

So much better than Apple. Apple many many many more apps available then Apple more convenient and easier to navigate everybody should have a Samsung and Play Store app I downloaded the Play Store app on an Apple product what's messing with that,5
Correction It is a very good app. Think about groups for selecting a new manager when group manager gouing out of the group .i sugest the group should select another manager from members.you know other wise many text and media should loose when generate new group.,5
Absolutely superb,5

Samsung fame lite Success battery saver you get 100 stars*******thanks,5
One of the best launchers that I've ever used. Highly customisable  very fast  good predictive suggestions  light weight. Another thing that I realised after starting to use the launcher was that I'm no longer mindlessly opening apps like Facebook  Twitter or WhatsApp just because i see the icons on homescreen. I now need to mindfully type the app name (first few chars) to get there thus making it very effective. The search function and alias naming is amazing. Just one suggestion/question: is it possible to have the suggestion bar at the bottom empty till the time i start typing some function or app name?,5
Good Easy accessible,5
Great app! This app just makes my life easier. Totally recommendable!,5
Excellent App Using on my Nexus 6p and it is working well and of course better than the default one.Thanks,5

I reset my phone into factory settings  then installed WhatsApp lost chats; installed Telegram loaded my previous chats from cloud backup. And guess what  it is more secure. The only down factor is the idiots insist on using a trojan app instead of this.,5
Ok Super,5
Holy cow! Amazing app! Best out there! Simple and clearly created by an organized mind. This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. You are a genius! Thank you  thank you  thank you!,5
Nice ! But.... First I'd like to suggest to disable that home button action because it turns the lock screen off......and adding some shortcuts on the lock screen would make it very good..i hope you do it in next update..,5

Best game in beta I've played First  it isn't a roguelike - the game is not procedurally generated and death is not permanent - and it lacks animations  which initially put me off to the game. But this is a great RPG with uncommon gameplay elements  unique quest plot  presents the player with moderate difficulty  and features a surprisingly large world (for a game in beta). I've probably put 100 hours into the game and still haven't seen all that there is to see.,5
thanks,5

Hi,5
Really Useful!,5
Worth paying for I rarely  rarely spend money on apps because I haven't found many that are worth spending money on. As the sole employee for a small business  I am constantly behind on bookkeeping  partially due to receipts being scattered and multiple account tracking. I'm excited to find this app to help me keep on track  which I'm already doing two weeks into purchasing the app. Would like to see the ability to add multiple photos to a receipt for those purchases that are more then one page or don't fit into one photo.,5
A must have! God i hate those spam email chimes at 2am. This application probably saved my marriage.,5

"Control gps? Dear Devs  is there any chance you could allow the ability to control gps? Someone replied to this earlier with the answer """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""uninstall the app if it's using GPS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" however that's not good. For example  facebook will use GPS but I don't want it to all the time  so turn off GPS but I turn it on for Google maps etc. Hope that helps""""",5

I can't tap anything to get it to continue and allow me to actually register  and it keeps telling me to register. Probably 5 stars whenever the developer gives this a compatibility update. EDIT: Speedy reply from the developer in my email. Had to go into Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Avare &gt; Permissions (grant all). That got it working as advertised! Great app  thanks for helping me solve this issue!,5

Amazing launcher for tech enthusiasts.

Merci le groupe de Google😀,5
THIS WORKS WITH LOCK SCREEN! I have to write a positive review in defense of this app. If you are into customizing your phone this app will work perfectly even on a non rooted galaxy s4 or like phone. Using this app in conjunction with say widgetlocker allows you to get the benefits of dash clock while keeping your stock lock screen on. So stop saying this won't work with a lock screen... It will if you understand android and enjoy customizing your experience. This actually is a great app that works very well.,5

Great app by a great dev. Use this in combination with greenify donation package and my phone last for 3 days on a charge easily. I have a one plus 3t running rooted stock mm OS and after using better battery stats to track down some pesky wakelocks I average no less than 9hr SOT on a full charge. If I don't use my phone for much of anything other than texts phone calls and some light social media and web browsing I can easily get 3days out of a full charge. Highly recommend this for anyone looking to get some serious use time out of their device.,5

Very good app It does what it says on the tin  and it does that really well. Let's you find out if an app  or apps  is draining battery juice unnecessarily. I've used for a couple of years now  but the recent UI overhaul has not only made it prettier  but far easier to see what you want to know too. I highly recommend this app for anyone who is having battery drain issues  or wants to prevent that situation  and let's face it  that's most Android users unfortunately,5

"I figured out a way to calibrate it! Take a piece of foam larger than your phone/tablet. (I used 1"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Styrofoam insulation) Float the foam in a bowl or your sink full of water. Place your phone on top of the foam and wait until it stops moving.......press calibrate. It should be fairly accurate at that point. I have a Samsung S2x with a battery that bulges out at the back and it was the only way I could figure out how to get level with it. Simple but useful app. Thanks. Edit- Decided to buy the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Pro Version"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Worth the $2 (Canadian :-) )""""",5
Good,5
Wish there was a way I could donate with Play Store - I would do it immediately! I've seen people on Australia publish paid versions  but looking at your Amazon quality  I am not able to send you anything. Is there another way? I don't use PayPal - its security shortfalls are too much. Any other way? For me  this so is the lifeblood of my library  so I'd like to have a way to send something.,5
Google is Bulbul,5
Excellent created app...,5
Good,5
its easy and convenient saves time,5
Love it,5
Love the makeover and new features. Keep up the good work!,5
Nice,5
Pretty awesome and accurate. I use it to level stoves  grills  smokers  and deer stands. I can use it to set the angle of elevation for a satellite dish.,5
LG Optimus L1 It's wonderfull wallpaper,5
A few bugs and crashes  overall pretty good!,5
Tops,5
I love it,5
Did that. Paid twice. Cant get trial expiration to change and cant unlock keyboard.,5
Nice,5
What happened to this app? Used to work great  loved it... but now everytime I hit the search the app closes... and when I have to scroll to find a song ( because I can't use the search or it closes ) the song doesn't download fully. Maybe I'll just uninstall it and reinstall it and see if that fixes the problem. If not I guess I'm just going to get rid of it. Ok...looks like that fixed the problem...the app is back to being awesome again😁,5
Nice Apps,5
It's good,5
Thanks Very good for us,5
Sleek Unlike other lockscreen apps  it doesn't try and replace your lockscreen  but works alongside it  only coming up when you've got notifications. It's an important difference and I like it.,5
A great trip down memory lane I only wish it supported even more old school formats (Amiga custom  SID  SAP...) but that's probably not the goal of this app and it already has the most important ones. The search on Mod Archive didn't work so well until I realized you could/should use wildcards: it might be worth mentioning it somewhere. Also  their database is sometimes incomplete/incorrect (specially regarding composers). Proposing alternative sites might help (AMP; any other?). Anyway  keep up with the great work!,5
Great Works,5
Very Good,5
Best podcast app out there Better than all the rest I have tried  keep up the good work. This is so good I would pay for it!,5
Nice. One gripe is the blur slider jumps from clear to very blurry  I can't seem to have it only slightly out of focus,5
Vinay Rangari,5
Awesome! This app/game is amazing  not. finished but amazing! Gotta grind  but if you are looking for an app you'll keep this is the one. Not for little kids. Ps (get bonemeal potions early).,5

It Works 👍 Great,5
The best messaging app. WhatsApp doesn't even comes close to the simplicity and feature it offers. I can go on ranting about its features  and most of them are so useful. Telegram innovates  WhatsApp just copies. Highly recommended 🙏,5
Excels at what it's supposed to do Love the app! Only synonyms and definitions don't work for some of the results (adin f.e.) Other than that its exceptional and completely free! Thank you!!!,5
Too bad. Loved it while it lasted.,5

Notification problems Notification is not working from15 days not in my device but every one's device after all settings....rest is fine everything..,5
Best until last update It is the best app to control kernel settings and using it for quite some time but after last update not able to change cpu frequencies.,5
I use it for my two phones and it works like a charm. But I want the app the backup incoming message instantly instead of 1 min.. Maybe the author can implement that?,5
Ringellous!!!,5
usefully,5
This app is perfect the way it is. It's fast  quick  and simple. Many people want voice and video added. If that was added  telegram would become like Skype. Slow. Please continue to fix bugs and add small features  just please don't add voice or video chat.,5

A must have for seeing all the storage hogs not visible from the stock file manager especially for those supposedly deleted apps and their data and allows deletion.,5
Cool app Thank you for that little magical tool. Precise speed control would be great. Or a tap button where you can input a speed by tapping a button. Color changes just look so !much nicer if they are matched to the beat. I love the widget. A pain if you always have to open the app. More functionality on that widget would be great. Oh and nearly forgot: the brightness fader is quite buggy on my Nexus7 2012,5
essential app for every android system. But updates are some time cause error,5

Nach whatsapp Plus Tötung  Sperre und Nachtichtenlöschung gewechselt Umswitchen ist so easy - und dafür gibt es in meinen Augen gute Gründe  denn das scheint ihr drauf zu haben im Gegensatz zu fu**books whatsapp: Sicher. Privat. Kostenlos. Synchron nutzbar auf mehreren Geräten! Schnell. auch bei Edge! Klemmt euch bis jetzt dahinter & geht persönlich auf Kritik in euren Bewertungen ein - SO muss das sein  bitte macht weiter so!! Einzige Frage bei mir: wie verdient ihr dann wenigstens etwas Geld?,5
Google Talk Back Why does 90% of the people who complain about the Google Talk Back App  are the whine asses that don't even use the dam thing to begin with anyways? You people don't even know what it does for people that have a hard time seeing  even with prescription glasses! But instead of only thinking about yourselves  why don't you think about the people that it is helping out tremendously on an everyday basis? God  people are just so inconsiderate nowadays  that it's really not worth even bothering with them!,5

Fun as can be! Nothing gives me that great  warm nostalgic feel quite like playing these games from my childhood such as secret of Monkey Island.

Really good camera application This camera app is way better than the default Android app that comes with my Nexus phone. It gives me a lot of control over the settings and I love the fact that I can boost the iso and shutter time to the maximum  very good for night shots. Manual focus is also quite nice.,5

I really like it. I do. I really like it. I do. Thanks for all of you doing.,5

BEST HABIT TRACKER IN THE PLAYSTORE I've tried several other PAID habit tracking apps and they do not compare to this one. Interface is clean and beautiful and very easy to use  but what really makes it for me is the amount of features it provides  all for free! The widgets are amazing! I love that I can see my progress visually in the graphs they provide  right from a widget. Setting up a habit is so easy and quick compared to other apps that take u thru several screens to select options. I would definitely pay for this app!!!!,5
Google play service Very good,5

Extremely important core system app Whatever you do  please DON'T DEACTIVATE IT! Don't disable it  and don't clear its cache! It isn't draining your battery. Facebook app is. Messenger app is. Keeping Location Services on is. This app is required for the smooth running of your Android device  even if you've disabled most of the in-built Google apps. Almost ALL app processes and services are dependent on it in some way. Yes  it uses up around 260mb of internal storage  but its indispensable functions justifies that.,5

Great app. Very fast. Good for group chats as well as personal chats. The best thing about telegram is that the files are not stored in the phones memory but on the cloud which makes it thousand times better than other apps coz you dont have to constantly delete files from your phones memory. Overall the best messaging app. I thing instead of using the by default messaging apps  people should switch to telegram. Love this app.,5
Really enjoy this I find it relaxing. I endeavour to be mindful,5

Just like using WinDirStat Great way to figure out what happened to all your space.,5
Love this reader. Tons of customization  decent text rendering and the support of Mobi-book format. The only thing negative I see so far is the slow opening  especially by ePubs: sometimes it took 10-20 secs just to open a book! If you can fix this  it would be perfect! The default view of the library is also confusing and not helpful. Better change the default view to show all books in bigger cover thumbnail. If you have under 100 books on your device  I think browsing all is the best way to navigate.,5
Just love it Do download it for it will make you feel great. Always works never fails along with many features. Best app for notifications.,5

Mm,5
Love the idea of having anonymity when it comes to browsing the Internet. This application is superior when it comes to a virtual private network and if you want to be completely a ghost this will be something for you to try. Many others seem to not be so aware that you guys can do wonders. You've earned yourself another donation. I hope this Network continues to do it's best. People need to give this application a break it's always going to be a work in progress.,5
Its really amazing!!,5
Good Apps Telegram is Very Fun,5
Useful,5
The Best I've Used At What It Does Even includes an option to reboot into safe mode  along with just about every other reboot option one could want. The UI is plain  but looks fine. Small complaint: the developer has his name above any of the options  which is sorta annoying to me (should be at the end). But the app is free...no ads  or unnecessary permissions required. 5 stars.,5
Sexy. Amazing  but the last CM update to M8 broke the dialer background for the numbers for me. Still 5 stars,5
Superb great work I was following these maps on computer always. Now it's available on my phone!!,5
Ok Best app store,5

"Add """"""""""""""""Lock Home Screen"""""""""""""""" option.. that is Lock the icons in home screen so it cannot be moved""""",5
Good App I use this app to sync my SMS msgs from time to time. I don't like deleting conversations that have sentimental value to me. I also prefer not to use Google sync & like the ability to sync only what I want when I want  & this app is great for that.,5
Were good,5
Best. Game. Ever. No exaggeration. No ads  easy on the battery  everything is customisable and easy to navigate. Game appears slightly crude  but rest assured what IS there is magnificent. 39 customisable games  from easy and master-able to tricky enough to where there's several games modes I'm scared to try in hard mode. Best game I have ever seen! This is what game makers should strive for!!,5
Good  comfortable  easy.,5
Very useful,5
Awesome Great features.. And most important ... It works!!,5

Best in Class Extraordinary reference library.,5
Delivers the functionality; needs changes to colors Land boundaries to use a different color tone. Tough to differentiate between land and weather elements easily. Cities need to be given a different t color tone too. This app meets the expectations bang on. In spite of the minor color tone related issues  this is a 5 star app all the way. I used this app a lot during Chennai floods 2015. This app gave one hell of a nightmare !!,5
Soooo good I love this game  but really would like to have a hunger meter so you know when to really eat  but other than that it is a really good game.,5

Love It So Much I love it so much. It's easy to use and it looks nice. It looks amazing and the ability to customize everything is so useful. It's so unique from the other apps I've used  I would recommend if you're even thinking about using something other than your stock messaging app.,5
"This Emulator Is For You! Reicast runs perfect on a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""nexus 7 Wi-Fi"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (haven't tried other devices) you just have to set your settings to give the best performance for your device. I really hope an action replay or some other cheat device is implemented soon. Controls are easy to use  and the video quality is amazing. I recommend this app to anyone who wants to play DC games with little problems.(I really hope a cheat system is added soon...)(could use a save state as well and an update to keep the date and settings from resetting every time I reset the emulator) """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I rate this a 5* Emulator even if there are not as many options as other emulators """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""yet""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""",5

Best Subsonic client still! I've been using this app for a few years and still think it has the best interface of any Subsonic Android client I've seen. Had some issues on my new Galaxy S6 Edge+ but after recent updates to the app and the Subsonic server back end  things seem to be working without issue again.,5
Simply perfect Beautiful  light  uncluttered  effective... I wish more apps were like this one. Congratulations to the developer!,5

I've used SMS Backup+ for a couple of years and it has worked flawlessly on my Samsung S4. I've installed it on another phone  a LG Leon and it now only backsup when I send the phone a txt message. Any other txt messages from anyone else will not backup until I send it one from my phone. Odd. Great program that has saved me through divorce court.,5

Great Player I've used xmp(1) on Linux and BSD for years. It's great to see it on Android with a nice UI. Even an old POS stuck on Gingerbread with 4GB storage can hold a solid week of music with XMP and a module collection. The playback quality is excellent as usual.,5
To say this is handy would be a huge understatement. Have used this many times to test coverage and check channel congestion; it's an absolute essential for any geek's phone. No ads / tracking / data mining / privacy invasions - such a refreshing thing to find a free app without all that crap. Thoroughly recommended.,5
Cool Is very good,5

Just like an SLR. Fantastic! Much better than my default camera. This app has presets that are normally found on a professional SLR. The app is fully customizable. I love being able to set the white balance  the zoom and the focus. The focus can be set to auto  manual  face detection or continuous. Continuous focus allows me to create a nice dof effect. It also comes with a timer and Burst mode is fantastic. I love being able to set the size and quality of the image. Thanks for sharing this remarkable app.,5

The most reliable messenger available The sheer customization potential and expansion of Telegram is nearly unlimited  with thousands of channels and bots  plus lightning fast and secure messaging. You can use it on almost any platform  and with its lightweight build  it doesn't burden older devices. The developers are keeping busy adding new functions  so you can rest assured knowing that new features are always on the way.,5
Not Good,5
Finally :) ok  gotta give this app 500000 out of 10. First app that I have used on Android that actually lived up to its description AND then some. I purchased a bluetooth keyboard for my tablet  and it's pathetic. doubles the keys  some dont even register  laggy.. but this app? one small telnet session? and it works! I was dubious. but it's great  and if only shift+arrow keys allowed you to copy individual letters out of text  it would be perfect. I am amazed this works so well  terminals are now a pleasure to use :) Cheers!,5
Awesome,5

Absolutely Amazing The active notifications are simply ingenious. Touch the icon and you can preview the notification. It works with every app I receive notifications on. (Facebook  my texting app  WhatsApp) I love that I can pull my phone out of my Otterbox and the screen wakes up. Also  it'll wake the screen up if I lift my phone off of the table. The sweetest feature to AC Display is the widget integration. I like customizing my phone and being I can use KWGT to make a custom lockscreen it solves my custom needs.,5

"Absolutely excellent highly recommended ? Its very rare I give a full 5 ?'s  but this just one of those rare moments. This is one of the best most simplest apps for tracking fuel usage & costs. If all you need is to track fuel consumption with stats look no further. I would like to thank the Dev for a really good user friendly app. If you ever expand on this product  I have only one suggestion """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""general vehicle expenses"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" like registration  servicing  etc  just focus on the standard stuff. This is only a suggestion.? Keep up the great work Dev ?""""",5

Have loved  LOVED this app for years!!! A few days ago I lost all email and if I receive one and read it  within minutes it too is gone.

"From a stay at home mom This has been an elegant solution in helping me keep up with the daily&weekly things I need to remember to do for and with my 2 year old son. AND  my favorite part is that the graphs and statistics hold you accountable!(as well as the reminders). The graphs and stats also kinda make it fun and like a game. If you want you're stats or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""points"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to go up  you'll want to complete yours tasks!""""",5
Good app kQkq2W8L It's so awesome. I and my husband chat every night. Although we are in the same bed  we turn our back on each other and turn the software on to message. It has a beautiful blue interface. The layout is easy to use. Thanks the publisher alot,5

Keep Facebook away from your data  and your battery! This application is an indispensable asset if you want the convenience of using Facebook as a social media platform and messaging service without the worry of Facebook mining your phones location and browsing data. It also combines both Facebook functions into one easy to use (albeit crude) application. No bells and whistles here  but that's a good thing. This app also has the added benefit of being %100 battery friendly  whereas Facebook wakelocks your phone 30-40 times an hour.,5
Love It is there any way of controlling it when not in wifi zone with bluetooth??,5
Nice aap,5

Tout simplement incroyable ! On a vu des emulateurs DS  PS2  GameCube  mais PSP stable c'était introuvable... Et là on nous sort un truc qui arrive à faire tourner pleins de jeux commerciaux (je fais tourner WipeOut Pulse sur mon SIII)  sur PC  iOS  Android et même BlackBerry ! Des mises à jour régulières qui améliorent vraiment le programme à chaque fois... Un très grand bravo au développeurs ! Je ne met pas 5 étoiles car l'émulation est encore loin d'être parfaite  mais je sais que cela va s'améliorer ! BRAVO !,5
Excellent app Works great on my Note 8.0 and with a powered micro-usb-hub works on my Z3 compact too. Looking forward to scanning and would love to see audio recording added. Thanks :-),5
This is a wonderfully elegant solution to a difficult UX challenge. The controls permit a nice degree of customization  and it doesn't need to know everything about you. Nice!,5

The best This game over all awesome. It makes funny comic strips or anything really.,5
Hamidu Awesome game  it feels like the dark souls of mobile gaming,5
"Awesome game!!!! Well written  engaging and unique stories. Many quests  not all require hack 'n' slash (which is realistic) and the story outcome truly depends upon the choices you make. The game is free because its an """"in our spare time"""" project  which is the real reason updates have been a long wait. But there ARE updates coming up  the next one is being tested now. One review reads  """"I wish there was a D-pad"""" obviously that guy didn't check his player options! Adding sound would take up memory that the dev team would rather use for more story elements  items  towns and quests. Sprites are all free license and the game is available in multiple languages. Some new players have gotten involved with development  so there will be original sprites in the future (I'm guessing... since at least 4 of the new people are artists). Plus the AT forum community is the best there is and quite helpful! Get it  keep it  and get into the forum to stay informed!",5
Superb,5

Absolutely Best Camera ever!! I can't believe what this camera is capable of!! I use this everyday for work. There are two levels to this camera app. Level one is same as all the rest but a little better. Level two is for anyone that changes settings. Extraordinary!! The Camera will imprint a logo on picture your words/font/ color. Before my pictures always needed to be cropped. Now the item is framed automatically. I never need to crop anymore. So amazing. There is a compass feature this shows the cameras alignment to item. Best A++,5

"Full Circle Though Vim (or vi) has been my favorite text editor for nearly 20 years  I completely get that biggest hurdle for most people is the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""mode oriented"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" editing environment. Ironically  it's this very modal nature that makes it so usable on a small form-factor device like a phone without having to sacrifice any of its editing power. (Of course  having a keyboard like the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hackers keyboard"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" with real TAB  ESC  and arrow keys makes life much easier  but even that's not absolutely essential in this port.)""""",5

Crazy awesome! Everything works as stated  wet it needs is a different way to activate the flashlight make triple press or press and press and hold  it doesn't work the same way when the screen is off though. When you enable it on screen off and it doesn't activate on pressing he two volume keys at the same time try volume key down then up. I don't why it works that way on my Samsung Galaxy Grand Neos. Otherwise thank you waiting for that update and keep up he good work.,5

Its a great PSP emulator. Its easy to use  works so well  and I have had no problems with it. As long as you can search for iso's it will play any PSP game easily. You should still support developers and buy the game as well so we get more games and show we want ways to play these types of games on our pc 's or phones,5

A rare jewel It's really a joy finding a piece of software that's this well-done. There is simply no better way to retain information than through flashcard programs like these  and Anki is the program for power users. Although editing cards on mobile is difficult  it's 100% compatible with the full-featured desktop version of Anki  so all management can take place there. Couldn't be happier.,5

Using this I can predict weather better than Met Dept So much info we can get over public access for free. Thanks for the development team for keeping it simple. It would have been better if I could see hourly images of each type  prediction would have been more accurate by looking at the trend of cloud movement  temperature change and wind direction & speed change.,5

All you could want in a life counter app. Simple and intuitive  with a great clean design and NO ads  unlike 95% of the other poorly designed and ugly life counter apps available in the play store. You can easily gain/lose 1 or 5  it has poison counters and optional flip  plus the design is beautiful and elegant. Seriously  what else do you need or want? Perfectly done!,5

Mighty app This app is not only helpful  it's also addictive! I did have an issue: I removed media from deleted decks in Anki desktop  then synced to Ankiweb  then to Ankidroid. For some reason Ankidroid would restore those unlinked media files  so I had to delete all my decks  do an empty cross-sync and start over. Not a big deal being a useful and free app  but I would recommend to anyone with the same issue just to save time if the sync keeps mumping up. Huge thanks to the Dev Team!,5

Very Nice App!!😊👍 Yeah it's very comfortable to read or getting the in depth information about any particular topic..!! So for that thanks a lot to the person who made this app..!! I hope in future he/she can make better than this.. so for that all the best..!!,5
Use it to block both whatsapp accounts I have two SIM cards in dual phone  and sometimes I need to change to other one so this app help me with a simple widget turn off whatsapp and go with the other easily.,5
Best app of its kind! Only wanted to leave some feedback  as good as all of the commands are  I think you should program some special ones for common apps like whatsapp  for example whatsapp -c (call) contactname  or same with messenger  or maybe even spotify -p (play) playlistname. That would make the app a lot better and unbeatable.,5

Finally! After wasting a full day and several file managers and basically getting nowhere. This has saved my bacon. Had lots of misleading folders on my HTC M8  that had me going in circles. The clear space map helped me worm out these  and see where most of my phone internal storage was being wasted. Can't thank you enough Ivan. Will gladly donate if you let me know the details x,5

Finally got the bulk of my friends to switch from Messenger  and I'm glad I did. I love the ability to make sticker packs  and masks  and the bots are fantastic. Just two suggestions: Messenger-esque chat heads (I'm using Flychat at the moment  but something built-in would be fantastic)  and support for the new image keyboard API in 7.1.1 would be fantastic  especially with Gboard rolling out now. Thanks! EDIT: woohoo  you did the keyboard thing :),5
Great Open source  great dev  what more to wish for,5
It's good,5
Listen up Just because it's difficult doesn't give anybody the right to give this game a bad rating. It is so hard to find a good dung/mob/slash and hack game out there. This is a game for true strategist's and expert dungeon delvers. I say bravo. I have yet to beat it personally but I've been to floor 18 with all three classes before I met my demise. Bravo on this game guys! Keep them coming!! Just saying there should be a save option though.,5

No better This the most thorough  most customizable  most easy to use app for cataloging a book library. It's also extensively scalable. I have added hundreds of titles so far and it shows no signs it will not handle hundreds or thousands more. I looked at dozens of apps for cataloging my library. This is hands down the best. By a wide margin.,5
Excellent OK a little overfeatured for me XD but I think it's about time I get above the cheap camera functionality. Time to learn & re-learn. My single objections are 1. caveats to save to SD card (which is courtesy of Android actually) and 2. p-p-p-please enable an option to name picture files appending them by date-time :) Samsung Galaxy Core 2 rooted.,5

Older versions ie. JB etc  use an older version. Newer Versions of Android  use the latest. Fixes most issues on startup. Make sure you have init.D support and Proper SELinux support. Seems to be abandoned  no word from author. The only Firewall for rooted device is this one. Open Source for developer scrutiny and free. Beware there is a CopyCat Chinese version of this going around. This is the original. Use this one.,5

Best in class The simplicity  ease of use and Look and feel of this app must be an inspiration for other app developers. They must take a leaf out of the 'Ad free' and 'No in-app purchase' policy.

I really like this app. I come from flow home launcher and there are a few thing I do miss in this launcher  1. notifications on screen. (with some interactions) 2. twitter feed If these two things are integrated into this app  I will forever be fixed on this launcher as my daily driver. Good work devs  I hope my suggestions are incorporated.,5

In general over the years I've gotten .txt and mobipocket ebooks that I imported to my android smartphone when I bought it. It works great. Has animation  day/night mode  3 fonts  tons of sizes and the option to search ebooks by filetree in your device. Works like a charm. UPDATE 01/04/2016. Now syncs across devices via Drive 6stars!,5

A nice FOSS version of Minecraft I actually just heard about Minetest when flipping through a free and open source repository. That said  I am impressed with how many features Minetest has. It plays a lot like Minecraft to the graphics and gameplay  but it does offer extra modding features to extend things even more. Shoutout to the contributors to the Minetest project for making a cool open source version of Minecraft  and to more interesting things down the road.,5

Much better than Android's built in disk analysis tool Unlike many utilities which lump system files into one general category  this tool shows a detailed breakdown of the storage space used by apps and their associated caches  making it very easy to pinpoint exactly what's using your FLASH.,5

Love it! Nice simple and fast! Works great!,5
Super It is a helpful app it helps to play PSP games and all games are supported,5
Perhaps the negative posts reflect an older version of the application. I downloaded  installed the app and since I already had an ID/password & authority to publish on our club website  I had my first couple of posts with photos and text up on on the site within minutes. Highly recommend; if it doesn't seem to work for you  check with the administrator of your WordPress powered website to make sure you have the appropriate posting privileges.,5
What a great pro tool Very similar to Quick System Info Pro  but I think OS Monitor is a little bit better. A shorter refresh interval would be useful.,5

Great App! Tells you how many minutes and what time the BART gets to you! Tells you how much it's going to cost to get to your destination. It even tells you what time you'll get to your destination.

Reicast: Now the only worthwhile Dreamcast Emulator. Period. Even as a successor to NullDC  it is FAR more easy to use than that product wished it could be. And even for an Android based program  it's one of the best of it's kind. And even for a supposed ALPHA  it's fantastic at what it does and only has a few losses in game compatibility that  especially this early in development  are sure to be resolved soon. Anyone with even a passing interest in Dreamcast games  this is a must.,5

Credit where it is due Truly ad free as promised. Simple  effective  and very helpful. The developer deserves a lot of credit. There are far too many apps that load ads just as you go to push a button  sending you to a Web browser page. If you are fed up with that as well  then look no further.,5

Wow! I installed without expecting much  or that it would be a keeper  but I love it! So far I think it's better than a touch launcher as I don't have to hunt through icons for an app. One thing I'd like to see is argument auto complete not clearing the preceding command  e.g. if I type (or auto complete) help and start typing an argument e.g. 'ap' (for 'apps') then when I auto complete 'apps' I don't want it to clear the help command - 'help ap' currently becomes 'apps' after auto complete.,5

Great app  love the map details when switched to bicycle. Offline maps is also very helpful when out on the motorcycle in the country. You can alter your settings under 3 profiles of driving  bicycle  or walking. One bug I've found is after software update I lose settings like recording my track to gpx etc. I'm also trying to figure out how to add red light cameras for the community to see. Apparently this is done through openstreemap dot org and is a more complicated process than it sounds. So for this I still use WAZE when in the car and OSMand+ for cycling or motorcycling where reception can be shotty.,5

Also supports call logs and MMS too (I get some folk will have privacy issues  but hey if your reading this the NSA/MI5 know who you are...?) Lol ? That fact that this app does its job very well indeed I felt compelled to make a donation which I did. Regards,5

Allright Ok,5
Best app on my phone.. Including phone itself. After trying 7-10 other e-book readers and finding multiple issues with each one  I stumbled across this one (thinking it looked so basic it was gonna be another crappy one) with nothing to lose...6 years and 7 phones later it remains my all time favorite  and most used app ever. I use it by far more often than any other app  including the phone dialer. Every new phone I've gotten this has always been the first app to go on  and flawless syncing with FB reader and Google drive means I just have to download and sign in on new phone and everything is right in the world again.. plus I can pick up any of my multiple devices and open to same spot no matter what device I stopped on.. Can't go on enough about how much i love this reader.. bought the premium version not because the free one was lacking.. Honestly if I never even open the premium version and kept using the free one it will be worth the price after the years of enjoyment from free one.. Really just buying it to thank developers. Couple of small changes might make it PERFECT (really I'm nit picking here) 1. Auto scroll would be awesome for people like me who need larger font so we don't need to turn page every 3 servings 2. Pinch to adjust font size (for same reason) 3. Bookmarking could be made easier with dedicated space in corner... And that's all I can think of that isn't perfect,5

I am loving this app. My feedback is I would love an option to sort the apps how they appear on my screen... For example: sort by time of reminder  sort alphabetically  sort by date added  etc. Maybe also the ability to group a number of habits... For example: habits related to health  food  pets  children  reading  or whatever topic you need or prefer  etc. Hope you can help with this!? Absolutely loving this app though even if you don't make these little changes.,5

It's decent I've used this same program on & off for about 3 1/2 years now. I've done my own research on Binaural Beats and brain synchronizations when I heard about this. The concept for this is without a doubt interesting. But since it's difficult for me to keep my mind from wondering  I have always had problems using this consistently. I will say that since I have known about this apps existence  I ALWAYS download this specific app because it has always remained reliable to an extent for me. Thanks developer(s).,5

Works great but not perfect. Performance is outstanding but I got a bug on Sonic Adventures 2. It won't load the 8th level Aquatic Mine. Game saved fine but it always freezes before the level loads. The emulator won't close after this.. Also crazy taxi acts like a music cd instead of a game. I remember having the same problem with the actual console but I could just remove my memory card to fix it but I can't eject my memory card here. Also can't adjust control stick sensitivity and the thing is hard to use more often than I'd like.,5

Better than ever It was great that the developer listened to the user feedback and improved upon it. The option to tap and hold to copy the Username or (especially) Password has been brought back. Also the new dark theme is really nice looking. Great job!,5
This works great so far. Any plans for support of Q branch direct sampling for HF reception on RTL SDR? Maybe the option is there and I missed it. Great app  keep up the great work.,5
That's good,5

"Really liking it Just downloaded this app so I'll change the review if my opinion changes but so far I realty love it. I especially like the widgets that are easy to check off. I think it would be great if they added a way to save data with it  for example track my weight with my exercise habit. Also it would be nice to have a tiered habit. For example """"""""""""""""drink a gallon of water a day"""""""""""""""" could let you repeatedly check it off in quarter gallon increments  allowing partial accomplishment and tracking progress throughout the day.""""",5

Beautiful simplicity I wish I had known this launcher earlier. I have tried almost all launchers in the Play Store. I couldn't settle with even the most elite launchers with loads of customization options. This one is simple yet beautiful. A simple command line interface seems to have hit the sweet spot against so many other effects-filled launchers. As someone else has written that its a huge sense of relief from GUI  transitions  widgets etc. Very true. The RAM usage on top is a good info. for the user. I wish there could be,5

'Disk-uss' worthy Being an absolute app & apk fanatic  it was difficult keeping up with all the junk that installing and uninstalling left behind. Once I decided to do a bit of research  I read about this one. Easy isn't a bold enough term to describe it! See for yourself! :-),5

"So much better than AnyConnect Batch mode and cached credentials mean that when there's a work emergency I don't waste valuable time accessing my password manager  selecting """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""trust this application"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and accepting the SSL certificate every time. Streamlines the connection process beautifully  and the app as a whole is much faster than AnyConnect. Fantastic work!""""",5

"Amazin simple and intuitive Simple and super intuitive design! Helped me spot all memory heavy files in 15 seconds. The app is not intrusive and does not require any other permissions apart from accessing memory. I usually don't leave reviews  but the author definitely deserves 5 stars! One advice to improve the app is to add """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""open"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" functionality directly to the block of file eliminating the need to click on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""show"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button""""",5

"Simplicity and Style Simple and functional interface - it is my favorite and a joy to use. What I would still love to see is the possibility to pre-define more than one multiple timer (maybe a second row  even though I can see the difficulty to display the length of each period for distinguishing between more of them) Additionally  an option to prevent the device from rotating  e.g. forcing the app into portrait mode  would be great. I would also like to have a possibility to choose where the remaining time is shown because - depending on the background image - the middle of the screen can sometimes be inconvenient. A request that's a little over the top :): I love the sound of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Three Bells""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  it would be great if this same sound was available as one single bell. Thanks for a wonderful app :)""""",5

Suggestion I suggest they include two tabs  one for internal memory and one for SD card. Because we have to navigate to the root folder and navigate from there to SD card. Or make the Storage folder the default folder when the app is opened. Other than that it is very good. Nice clean interface  no annoying popup messages  no ads  no unwanted permissions. Thank you :),5
"The sheer customization potential and expansion of Telegram is nearly unlimited  with thousands of channels and bots  plus lightning fast and secure messaging. You can use it on almost any platform  and with its lightweight build  it doesn't burden older devices. The developers are keeping busy adding new functions  so you can rest assured knowing that new features are always on the way. I'd love to see an option to totally turn off """"Last Seen"""" on a per-contact basis.",5

Possibly the best Rogue-like game ever This game is the best of any rogue-like game  very hard  all strategy  infinitely playable so simple but so complex at the same time. A must play for anyone who loves RPG games but have patience! You won't even beat the first boss without dying 20+ times first  its just the nature of the game. Easily a 5 star rating EDIT: still the greatest game I've played on my phone. Beaten two characters  two to go. The degradation feature really sucks though  I wish it was optional.,5

Sono sempre stato scettico nei confronti dei molti cloni di whatsapp che purtroppo mancavano sempre nel copiare la cosa più essenziale: velocità e leggerezza. Ecco  telegram mi ha stupito superando whatsapp nelle sue caratteristiche principe  con alcune chicche in più come gruppi segreti e invio di documenti. Speriamo si diffonda perché è davvero eccezionale .,5

Crazy good app! 🙌 I'm telling all my friends about it. And I love the stickers. Great that I can also use the app on my PC. I have an idea: how about a reminder feature to help you remember to write something to a specific person on a specific date? Or a send later option. I sometimes think that would be great. I also know that some of my friends don't know that they can edit or delete messages. Maybe you should send another notice somehow for those who don't read the changelogs.,5
***** Awesome luncher  few bugs for some commands sometimes shows null pointer error like status and some apps are not listed in apps hope for future updates to fix the issue but all in all great luncher. Thanks.,5

Such a great app I once had a Windows Phone and one of the things I really liked about it was how cleanly it displayed relevant information on the home screen. This app is the Android answer for that. I love how I can see my upcoming appointments  alarms and tasks alongside email counts all cleanly presented on the home screen. No upcoming items? Then there isn't an entry on the screen until you have one. Kudos to the developer on this app.,5
I cant install superuser why? I donwloaded it and finished download but cant install superuser dont know why :(,5

Great RSA Replacement for 4.4.4 OS I tried to get the RSA native client working but it wouldn't import from either QR code or URL. I added this app and moved my RSA .SDTID file to my Samsung Galaxy S5 and was able to install and configure my device and was logged in with my software token in less than 30 seconds. Sure beats the heck out of downloading all the JAR files and nonsense that one has to do with the native RSA conversion application. GREAT JOB!!!,5

Exceeds expectations I recently purchased a Note 10.1 2014  and I was curious if there were any android apps that would let me fetch and view protein structures from the PDB. This app far exceeded my expectations. It has the smoothest rendering of any viewer I've used  including desktop applications. It allows various color options  display of the biological unit  fetching from the PDB. I'm sure there are some advanced options that were removed  but for a tablet viewer  I'm hugely impressed.,5

Awesome game Everything about pixel dungeon is so awesome. It's deadly punishing  but it makes it that much more rewarding to beat the game. You have to be really careful with what you're given - every item down to the last dewdrop counts! - and in the deeper you go the more strategic you have to be. Thanks for making such an amazing experience  and happy dungeon crawling!,5

Really great icon pack! Everything's sorted out except for the fact that a custom style applied to the theme appears to break / prevent some apps from loading. One example is Feedly. If I apply another icon-pack in CM11 aside from this  the app loads as expected. Any chance we can take a look? Keep up the good work!,5

Best app Easy to use,5
I always read the homepage as it's filled with neat articles from a wide range of popular sources,5
Smooth  polished  and the text-chat interface concept is a brilliant idea that is very well implemented here. I grew up in the 1980s playing these Infocom titles  and while I go back to them every so often as an adult  I've yet to get that same feel from mobile Z-machines (such as Son of Hunky Punk  which otherwise is also good). The chat-text interface here is the perfect transition to modern mobile platforms for these games  and I'm frankly amazed that no one had thought of it before. As others have mentioned here  the only real point of frustration I have is the lack of .z4 support  which eliminates later classic Infocom titles such as A Mind Forever Voyaging. But for about 70-80% of Infocoms and virtually anything produced in the Inform era (post-1997 or so)  this Z interpreter is just spot on. I'm giving this five stars  because it deserves it  even without .z4 support. With .z4 support  I'd be petitioning Google to make a six-star rating possible.,5
Ok So nice so good,5

"Bookmarking Nirvana I was a big user of del.icio.us and suffered through its declining Yahoo and Hurley/Chen days. It always had to be something more than simply a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cloud stored"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" bookmark that you could optionally share.

FIXED!!! Please fix VirusTotal support.-UPDATED - FIXED VirusTotal support fixed...this app jist went from 3 to 5 stars! Half of this apps usefulness is its VirusTotal feature and it has stopped working. When I tap on VirusTotal  it says unable to load webpage. Please fix.,5
Had some difficulties setting up but the developer was quick to help so 5 stars the app itself is awesome and works great.,5

Using on my MI PAD tegra K1! Awesome Not every game or app using full frequency of cpu & GPU. because I felt that games are little bit lagging due to full force on cores. I just under lock my cpu frequency to 1.5 GHz and GPU to 396 MHz. and guess what the games are running smoothly as well as battery life increase. I am playing all games like asphalt 8  modern combat 5😃😃😃😃 on full graphics. just increase cache size  entropy values to max and low memory killer to light mode and it's a balance combination of performance & quality. no words 5/5😉😉😉😉😉,5

Camera for me My default app once started using it. Superb features and provides full control. Can be confusing for many(simple users) with so many choices in settings and hence requires default set of settings for them. Changes in new updates are great.,5

Need for Pin to bottom feature The new updates are very good.It was greate if there was a 'Pin to bottom' or 'turn off floating' feature to pin or disable floating for some groups or chats to the very bottom of my list because most of the time there is no need for some of them to jump to the top even when thier notifications are set to off.,5
Best ever It is vaery fast and easy to use and look for songs,5
Fast,5
Must have,5
Just a heads up for the uninformed This app can/does NOT hack Clash of Clans! If you put a specific IP address in a hosts file  it blocks the incoming connection from the specified IP (from everything I know  a lot). The reason you need root (also called superuser) is because the Hosts file is a SYSTEM file  so only root can modify it (sorta like when you open/run something  i.e. CMD as administrator on Windows). And to the people who are rooted but still have problems  make sure you have Busybox and SuperSU installed.,5

I'm surprised that this game is this fun. Already finished this game 3 times now  each with different subjob. one of the best rogue-like i ever tried since castle of the winds. Replay value is huge because your item build  the dungeon  and your luck will never same  also there is a badge and challenge system. the number of job and mastery is also pretty balanced. The only thing I annoyed at this game is the equipment detoration feature :/,5

"Very useful tool! First  if you're a hunter with a smart phone  get this app! It's a great guide for finding the small things you're looking for  like how to get a Commendation G  or the drop rate on Rathalos Plates. For the devs  would it be possible to include pre-requisites for quests? A line such as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Condition to Unlock: """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" would be perfect for aiding hunters and preventing confusion as to why they do not have a quests for an unknown reason.""""",5

Coming from an rpg lover... Get this app  guys. If you loved any old  turn-based rpg you played on the old Gameboy  you'll love this. There's a perfect blend of fun  logic and a little bit of a challenge all mixed together to make this roguelike phenomenon. It's not the best game I've ever played  but it would definitely be on my top ten list. Now  if there was only an ability to craft your own weapons... you already got partially there with the option brewing. Really fun  9.5/10.,5

Just realised this app doesn't allow you to change the short notification sound to a long ringtone  or set the volume for the calendar alarm independently from the android notification volume. Damn  that was the main functionality I wanted  as C.E.R app no longer reliably fires. My mistake  re-checking the app description  it doesn't mention these features. Strange  as these are the most common features I would want. Persistence is handy  as is snooze  but not as important to me. Will un-install. Good lu,5

Just like trebuchet. You can install trebuchet using cyan apps but this is sometimes a little hit and miss as to whether it'll run. This launcher is trebuchet for the masses  it works exactly like it  no lag and very clean. I like the app drawer style of this launcher and will continue to use it as long as possible.,5

Perfect way to see the calendar in a detailed but convenient way It functions perfectly  the customization is nice to fit more information on screen and to avoid the eyesore that some other calendar widgets produce if you have a dark or transparent theme with your launcher. My only suggestion for the developer is to allow the Google now reminders in the calendar feed like the default Google calendar widget does.,5
Very nice app,5
Wonderful This app has all the Tripitaka  an intro guide  and even a Pali dictionary. In short  it's got all you need to begin a thorough study of Buddhism. The only change I would make is to allow it to be moved to the SD card. That would help a lot.,5

Google Star speed,5
Thanks to HTC 10 it not bombarded my phone with google apps usually or mostly branded phones force mobile phones to put unwanted google apps and even if u disable them they automatically keep on updating and makes your phone slow even if you don't want some stupid google apps they force to install without u knowing and there is no possibility to uninstall it because they want future phone policy for you to buy new better phone with highest ram and highest internal storage... Phone industrial tactical continues... However in future phones market will succeed if they provide Coustomer free 5G net for 24 months for 1000 days with their new phone 1TB 5G internet for 1000 days... ;) as everthing will be on parallel cloude network screen...,5

Good strategy which offers Security as well as convenience in case mobile network is not available.

I'm only using some of its features but... I don't care for live wallpaper generally and usually prefer my own downloaded images as wallpaper (non-scrolling). I'm using Wallpaper Changer to rotate my favourite images as an extension to Muzei and finding that Muzei's blurring/dimming effect really makes my icons pop out - that a simple double tap will then bring the wallpaper into sharp focus is something I don't think I'll ever get tired of! In short  the Wallpaper Changer/Muzei combination is highly recommended.,5

I checked my ping on the server from the main screen and its averaging 30-70ms  but my friends are saying things 10-15 seconds before I hear it. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or not.,5

Among the best Wallpaper apps! Update:The wallpaper now pans across all launcher pages and that is a feature added in no time ??. So it's more ?.(Works easy  no problems this far. Just can't get the wallpapers to scroll along with the home screen.They lie there still. Any clue?),5

Love the new visual feature. However  could you make the black crosshairs a different color which has more contrast with objects  such as green perhaps? The black blends into many objects and is very hard to see. Thank you! Amazing  light  simple app. Literally have had it for years; possibly the first app I ever installed. Since Android 2.1 I believe.,5

Was an awesome app b4 fb api change Now the app is useless like many others but I still will not nor ever download the fb native app until they actually make it work better than using the browser. I think we should start a class action against fb. Only reason they changed the api is so that we as users would have to log into our accounts to do anything and hence falsely increase their user stats for ad revenue like how many ads am I really going to see if I log in just to check friend bdays for the day in notifications instead of using an app,5

Thanks so much!,5

Very good and useful The best. I've tried many other backup apps but this one is the best because it simply synchronize with Gmail  allowing me to search for SMS and Calls directly on Gmail on my desktop. Very practical. The only problem is that if I change the system language it backups everything from scratch  creating duplicate entries for each SMS or call: one for each language. Please fix this. Also  recently I have to do manual backups since it doesn't work automatically.,5

This application actually works very well. It's nice to transfer my fast typing speed into fast phone typing. Plus I can set my phone up next to my computer and not have to worry about it. I only notice occasional blips of speed whereas the typing doesn't immediately get sent. I don't know if that's a fault of TelNet  the connection  or the app  but it hardly affects performance because it gets sent eventually.,5

In this Apperwall review  I marked it legitimate. Overall ApperWall is an easy to use extra income site that can help you find new apps and get paid for it. I like the payment system  ApperWall has a minimum cash out amount of $.50 and pays via PayPal. Since you’ll be earning a few bucks for review  you know you can always get paid right away. If you’re interested in getting paid to review apps  ApperWall is an excellent option.,5

Holy **** that's incredible - the DNG files from my centuries-old Nexus 5 are actually usable as actual photographs - I can't believe my eyes. RAW + manual exposure (fixed aperture on the phone  of course  but freely choosable exposure time and ISO) as well as exposure bracketing... I'm so impressed I can't quite think straight. My D750 is going to be quite jealous :D,5

The BEST text editor on Android If you are looking for a free text editor on Android which could rival Notepad++ / gedit  look no further - this is it! Works well on my ASUS N7. Far better than the tons of adwares in this app store (by orders of magnitude). Pretty easy to use - with an external keyboard and VIM command cheatsheet. Only a handful of commands are needed to survive its command line interface :),5
Free and wonderful!,5

Best best ever I love this Terminal user interface  I've never felt so comfortable with a launcher since I'm using android. But I'll appreciate your help more  if i can load credit from the terminal  hide the android notification bar and also display my ROM. Thank you. And also a security pass lock before operating the terminal will be very welcome,5

Must Read this! This is the best camera app for 1 reason. Most phone downgrade the saved photo taken by the camera to about 90% in order to save space. So you lose 10% of the picture quality. Then the release the next model with the same camera (you figure it out). This app allows you to save the pictures at 100% in settings. My note 3 camera looks like an iPhone 7.,5

Feedback Please add a feature to show a notification when an app  that has not been configured  tries to connect to the internet. Because sometimes an app depends on a service and it's difficult to know that (like YouTube depends on media server to run  so even if you allow YouTube  it won't run  unless media server is also allowed),5
From skeptical to believer I've experimented with binaural beats for years and I believe I was to you to appreciate it or even concentrate on it. Now I use it for sleep and I go right out.

The app is good but you have to focus on material design when composing a message the drop down contact list should also have a contact photo  Also the bubble of messaging is not looking good but you have to focus on it and in a conversation list there should be a check box which select which conversation need to delete  and block conversation should be displayed on seperate block conversation list Hope you will implement this feature in next update,5

Works like a charm Started using few years ago with a Samsung that had a WiFi bug. Tried everything to keep my connection going. Got so frustrated with that phone  if I could have would have thrown it into a busy intersection. Some how I found this app  installed it and like magic it was like a new phone. Now I install it on my phones just so I have a robo wifi connection. It has never used enough battery to even rank in the battery usage. The only thing I'm surprised about is why it has a low rating in the store. I've ran it on five different phones and a tablet and its always been all positives and zero negatives. I'm just guessing but I wonder if some people are expecting it to boost their signal or something. I realize it crashes on some. I've ran it up to marshmallow.,5
RINGDROID IS THE FIRST ANDROID APP I INSTALLED SINCE 2009,5

Lockscreen is beautiful! You may call it a beta but if set up right this can be an amazing lockscreen! I have this setup in 3 of my devices! All look stunning! A hat tip to you my friend! SUGGESTIONS: Allow the widget to be centered on the lock screen  currently it's kind of 70% vertical. Allow making the background blurred or frosted rather than darker. I will happily donate to you!,5

Perfect for my use case In a phone  it's unusual to need a file manager. This one fits the role perfectly for everyone's basic needs.

Nice app Easily makes a normal app a system app or vice versa,5
Gets the job done  just open app  click speaker  and audio already playing or future audio is immediately routed to the bluetooth device (Android 5.1.1  also putting on my other two Android devices). When done app doesn't stay around in the background bloating things up. Tip: to start  open app  click speaker  then click the standard Android O button to go back to home screen (don't click <| arrow or app will exit). Then when you want to stop routing  open app and just click <| to go back  which will quit app.,5

finally one that works! I ve tried them all  this is by far the best navi  not only because of the openstreetmaps feature. ui rendering could be more smooth like gmaps but it really isn't bothering. it even feels less like a toy like that. I want to buy it 3 times :),5

Great! Perfect  but needs a list of weapon combos. I don't know how much work I am asking of you  But figured that all weapons of the same type (bow  great sword  etc.) have the same combo list. If this is a lot more work than I think it is  well... GREAT job on this! Love it  so useful with the information  and how its displayed.,5

The current official version is 4.409  and it is excellent. However  today I installed the latest version posted at the K9 Mail developer's site  4.512  and additional improvements make this email client stand out by some distance. Even in comparison with Gmail. Wow!,5

Became an adict to Project Diva. It does what it says. Needs some optimization on a few games  but once you tweak a few settings here and there almost every game should run fine. One thing that I would love would be to be able move the memorycard to the sd and read all the dlc and stuff from there instead of wasting some valuable space on the little internal memory I have on my phone.,5

Five *s This is the only app of its kind. There are many budgeting apps  but this is the only one that very simply does one thing. No connection to your bank accounts  no dropbox sync  no default list of 150 spending categories. You put money into an envelope  you take money out of the envelope when it's spent. Plain. And. Simple. And  it looks good too!,5

[SOLVED] Broken root call for hiding the icon. Broken request for the root function to hide the status bar icon. It's annoying as hell and if I have the root I can obviously see the logs.Seems like Roundr has a broken call function for the root on SuperSU. Fix it and this small app will be great. Until then  I'm rating 4 stars cause of this nuance. Will write to you on XDA so you can see if everything is ok with code or it's my setup to blame. Edit: left a re in your thread hopping it's useful to you. Edit2: Solved the issue with notification icon and status with xposed module  rating upped to 5 stars :),5

The only sad thing is how long it took me to discover this app. Blacklisting and pinning apps (which can be automatically reordered in whichever way you want) is fantastic!

Simply the best,5
Best one yet One of the best camera software ever used  you can even create a folder wherever you like and save the pictures in that folder  I use this camera app for another type of pictures  not for daily use  and it does the job 100% of the time  especially the vocal use for taking picture,5
Unbelievable app! Backed up my text messages within minutes & then created its own label in Gmail with all information in tact. Wow!,5

Doesn't lose track of what you're listening to regardless of phone calls  reboots  or long-term pauses.,5

The app is excellent. Could you please add a feature to put privacy on a user's Profile Pic? So that only my contacts can see my Profile Pic if I choose to do so. Maybe someone just wants to keep the profile pic to themselves. Perhaps an option to make the users profile pic visible in certain groups that the user allows. This will allow the user to have more control over who can see their profile pic and who can't. Lastly an option that enables a user to have more than one profile pic. One profile pic for private contacts. Another different profile pic for Groups etc.,5
Great util to identify battery issues Using it for a while. Helped me on 2 phones to identify apps consuming battery.,5
Telegram It's great,5

Works for a shift worker Really surprised and impressed to find this does work and very well for me. I do shift work so napping before work is vital and falling asleep after work can be difficult.

I really like it but.... ..its an awesome messaging app I really like how far this app has come it's awesome and you can now change the text tone and color for each conversation which is awesome only thing left to do is but at least for an sent sound option. I mean even some the other crappier SMS apps have a sent sound so I mean might not be important to some ppl but it should an option. Please! I know it's not a big deal to most people but some people like having a sent sound and go back to the old qksms icon,5

Needs update though This app is great  but it needs an update since Marshmallow came out. It disconnects itself constantly and needs to be restarted for it to work again.,5
Never again will I miss notifications. Though I do have to say the app renaming to Snooze is a bit short-sighted as I would've never discovered this without the word notifications in the title. Is there any chance you can add Google tasks to this?,5

Really Nice Software Overall I have to give this Chess GUI an 'A'. You can see a lot of thought and hard work has gone into this program. That said there are to items I would like to see addressed. 1: Would like a option to change to Background Color of the Engine Analysis window that pops up/ overlays over the notation window. 2. Would like to see a option for Engine vs Engine with two 'different' programs  such as for example Stockfish vs Komodo and not the current engine plays itself.,5

I tried the other apps  and they are CRAP. It was a WASTE to DOWNLOAD those apps. I'm glad that u are back. So now I don't have to worry about missing my back ups no more. I can set it to 30mins and and it will backup my CALLS  TEXTS  MMS with no worry. So I recommend this app to anyone that's looking for a good backup app THIS IS THE ONE. DOWNLOAD IT NOW!,5

Actually works. I've been searching many hours for a file encryption system for Android. Most of them only password protect files in the app. The files are actually still wide open on the mobile device. Secrecy creates a vault into which you can import (move) them from the device. Even better you can export (copy) the files from Dropbox into a vault directly. This seems to be the easiest way to transfer files from computer to a secure location on a mobile device that I have found yet. If Dropbox was encrypted it would be perfect. For sensitive files it's probably better to USB them onto the mobile device instead.,5

Overall  this is a great game. I have sunk way more hours into it than I would like to admit. I do have one suggestion  though. It would be really nice if later in the game we had access to the scrolls of magical infusion. You can spend so much of the game getting the perfect build and upgrading your weapon only to see that the cool effects of an infused weapon disappeared from upgrades. Perhaps we could buy this scroll in the demon halls or it could be a very rarely found scroll throughout the game.,5

Download this now! This is the greatest messaging app I've ever come across. Seriously  the interface is seamless and actually IMPROVES with updates. You can now access on your phone or on a computer and everything's synced. The voice messaging feature is perfect for couples (and others) to maintain intimacy that text can't always give you. I can share websites  gifs  & pics with just a click. The only thing I'd love to see in the future are stickers with more variety of skin tones. (Also  sometimes  if I don't use the app for a few hours  it won't give new message notifications until I open the app.) Other than that  you will LOVE this app. I've been spoiled and can never use anything else. 💙💚💙💖,5

Gorgeous! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it crashes when it tries to switch the wallpaper when not on WiFi or when opening AllCast. After a reboot  it usually will not change the wallpaper unless I open it once. I notice it does not load at startup  maybe this would help with that. I use 500px as my wallpaper source.,5

A very big gem!!!! Being aware that something could work and actually experiencing that it does are concepts miles apart. I downloaded this app out of curiosity rather than any preconceived ideas  and when I saw pain relief and tried this out I couldn't have been more surprised to find that the treatment really works ! I have been in pain for a long time and I benefited from one treatment. So I have to recommend that anyone should try this app you have nothing to loose and like me everything to gain   many thanks to the dev!,5

Polished! Love the pop-up. Everything works nice now. I appreciate that it allows me to dismiss reminders by giving me a lot more snooze options than just 30 or 60 minutes. A wish.... That i could activate a text response by voice! Regardless  well done! Updated  after update to kk4.4.2 the app no longer removes the messaging apps notification. A little annoying but I'm sure the Dev will fix.,5

I've literally played minetest for about since it came out and I know some people rated this 1 but notice the minetest android version is still in development. This game is awesome.

How about adding a feature to schedule exporting APKs to the default/custom folder(weekly or monthly)  replacing the older versions of apps in it with updated ones? This would save a user's time and data after an unexpected data loss due to flashing or a corrupt OTA.,5

Battery saver! I live in a WiFi rich area  but don't want to waste my battery time searching for WiFi signals when traveling through the area. This app effectively only wakes up a strong WiFi connection when I am close to a known network.,5

5 STARS are Less Wonderful App,5
I love to play the games and movues,5
Good Talking about the Application  it's neatly arranged but somewhat it's not as satisfactory as it's Web Site form  I guess you'll update it in future with most simple layout to it  and talking about Wikipedia  it's the best  none can compete it so 5 stars aren't enough for it. I would have gave 4 and half  as the app isn't much simple to use.,5
The best gallery app There is no stock gallery app in the Moto Z Force Droid. I tried many photo gallery apps and this one is by far my favorite. Simple  adjustable  and it works. Great support from the developer.,5

Still one of the good ones! I had this app before and removed from a previous phone for space. Just never had installed on my (then) newer phone. (Using Note 3) installed tonight  downloaded quickly and was ready to calibrate. Calibration took a couple of trys and did end up using the figure 8 method to do so. (Explained in app) Went from low accuracy straight to high. Everything lined up perfectly. Such a fun app that's also very functional. Now I'm eager to see if it will work just as well on my new(er) phone upgrade.. Note 5.,5
Great app,5
Excelente Es simplemente la mejor aplicación de mensajería instantánea disponible en Google Play. Aunque sería bueno que agregaran la opción del estado y de videollamadas. Eso sí que los haría despegar.,5

De lo mejor Extraño los gestos del xbmc remote pero por lo demás lo han mejorado mucho.,5
So far so good I downloaded this app recently and i have seen some major increases in my download speeds but there is a fat chance of that speed being just a coincidence cause i was already getting slow speed i need to monitor this app more to see if this actually helps or not,5

Best EBook reader around! It can play almost any EBook format and is completely customizable. Some users find customization to be too daunting  but it's really the best thing about any app as it allows you to tune the app to your personal preferences. This app is also lighter than resource hungry aldiko that does little other than look good and it comes free! The ads are also completely unobtrusive. Love this app.,5

Bluetooth Priority I don't know if this is the place for this but  is it possible to add a bluetooth headset priority to the app? When I press play off my bluetooth headphones it always chooses a different music player. It also prioritizes that music player if it's been idle for 10 minutes or so. I don't know if this is something that can be added into the app or it's an Android OS or phone thing. I'm using LG V20 Android Nougat with LG tones headphones. Best Audiobook player out there!,5

best of the open document apps! Until LibreOffice of Android becomes available (if ever)  this is the best app for accessing and modifying odf/ods files. It handles password protected documents without a hitch and flawlessly integrated with the Hammerhilll printer app for printing documents to my WiFi printer. As new features get added to this there is no reason for OpenOffice or LibreOffice for Android. Nice work!,5

Stable  the power consomptiom is correct even with the screen on max brightness! A lot of options to configure the softthe way you like it. The only improvement that I can suggest is to simplify the the menu structure that is not so easy to understand. For example: allow to disable the POI directly in the search.,5

This is a great diagnostic app! If you really want to know what is going on  and which apps are eating your battery for breakfast lunch and dinner when its only mid morning? Well then look no farther  because now you can do something about it. In stead of just killing off other active apps why not learn to adjust settings to accomplish the mission. Better battery health and longevity! Oh and the miniscule cost is nothing compared to the amount of work that went into making this great app! Or you can get a free battery killer!,5

Love it! Simple to use. Really helps me with replacing bad habits with good ones. Only one thing to check: the streaks are displayed reversed. The missed days are shown as successful. For example  I have two weeks in which i didn't follow my habit and they show as a streak.,5
One of the best app.,5

"Really liking it Updated review after using for several weeks. This app is great. I especially like the widgets that are easy to check off. I think it would be great if they added a way to save data with it  for example track my weight with my exercise habit. Also it would be nice to have a tiered habit. For example """"""""""""""""drink a gallon of water a day"""""""""""""""" could let you repeatedly check it off in quarter gallon increments  allowing partial accomplishment and tracking progress throughout the day.""""",5
Feeling bored,5
Some songs don't fully download  but other than that it's a really good app,5

So hard  so good This game is fantastic. Though the objective is very simple it takes a lot of practice and quite some expertise to succeed in this game. But even if you do not get very far it is fun to play,5
"Amazing App This is an amazing app (one of the best ones  imo). I love the addition of color identity filtering  however  I think there should be an option for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Not any of these color(s)."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I feel this way because it is possible to have colorless commander decks  but the app is unable to allow you to search for cards that can go in there.""""",5

Literally endless entertainment. I can't remember how long I have been playing these puzzles. I have installed it on phone after phone because even if I master or get bored with one game there are dozens of others to choose from. It's simple no gimmicky adds and small footprint on a phone's storage. I very much like the dark theme being applied automatically when in a dark setting.,5

This is the very best book catalog app for Android available. I've tried every single one available in the Google Play Store  and most in the Amazon app store. It isn't perfect and I look forward to improvements but it's still quite good. It's easy and fast to use and provides a decent overview of books I've entered. I'm wishing for a few additional variable points to enter info I consider important. In the meantime  Book Catalogue is the best available in its category.,5

Don't bash devs b/c u don't know how to work ur phone or the apps installed on it!,5

Great functionality This is a clean and powerful camera app. Thank you! I have a question that you might be the person to ask.

These guys do their best to make this app complete with features for so many platforms. Their efforts deserve a5 star. There isn't a better emulator anyways. Could do with a little better GUI  but they are definitely putting the time into getting it up and running smoother  faster  better.,5

Awesome app! Widget? Friend told me about this app and I haven't touched another Bart app since. Super easy to use and the ability to click a specific train to add it to your notification bar is fantastic. Would love a widget to show next departure time for the station I'm nearest.,5
Very useful. This is possibly one of the most useful apps as far as I am concerned. And the developer has done well to keep it going great.,5

Wonderful app! My family and I are terrible at flipping coins  so we use this app for board and card games. True to its name  it really is simple and truly random. I made some Pokemon themed coins to customize it for our game. Thank you  this app truly is a gem.,5

High quality Fi,5
Minor flaws  otherwise phenomenal I can't put this game down. I keep dying over and over but it keeps drawing me in. Sometimes luck is in my favor and other times not so much. Knowing how much HP I have would be helpful if it could be listed in the bar instead of just a graphical representation. Also if the option to have a second quickslot could be permanently changed when I select it that would be great. Gets a little tiresome having to reselect it every new game.,5
The best! I run out of reasons why I love this app! One of the first apps I tried on Android and one that makes me feel like an astronomer!,5
Good ok Keep better,5
Good,5
Awesome :D Just overall a great game. Has its own tricky moments. Can feel unfair  but it all goes down to adapting to new levels. Definitely one of the best games out there!,5

Best app Google play service is very easy to use. Its very important app for our Androwed mobile phone.,5
Works Great on All My Devices Works Great on All My Devices  rooted and unrooted alike..,5
Great game The game is pretty balanced IMO. Once you get the hang of even the most advanced mechanics and a little sense of level generation  the game becomes less of a persistence test and more of a random challenge  forcing you to adapt differently in each run. I've cleared the game 7 times  but none of them with the huntress  sadly.,5
I haven't tried it out but I hope its good,5
Cooool,5
Great Game Its a great game and i love it but i just want some more new wepons  artifacts  armours  wands and rings. And how about adding a few more floors  enemys and scrolls/ potions.,5

I had been using Pocket Casts until I need to move to a new device. Pocket Cast moves almost none of your listening data. No playlists. No listening history. AntennaPod does this easily  and is free ND open source. Also  if there's a feature you'd like  there's a feature bounty program  so you can donate a few bucks and someone may add the feature for you.,5

Very useful and simple app! This app does exactly what it says it does. It takes less then 30 seconds to set up and makes typing long messages and emails (or Play Store reviews) much easier and quicker. It's not the most sophisticated app around  and may not be useful for people from a non-technical background (or who are unsure on how to use Telnet  for example) but otherwise it's great!,5

Dave Sharman Fantastic  very accurate. Love how you can omit stars and look where the planet's are. 1 constellation I can't find is the Pliaedies (or Seven Sisters). They should be up and off to the right of the constellation of Orion The Hunter  this is the most prominent constellation in the winter sky.,5

Has everything im lookin for. Its amazing,5
Amazing It's so great having tor easily accessible like this. And this latest update was fantastic. I've had little to no functional problems with the app itself. Tor by nature is hit or miss but the app works flawlessly as far as I can tell. Transparent proxying is sick too! My only complaint is that the graphics in the app don't scale well to larger screens. It get pixelated. But that's just cosmetic  and it's not like I'm going to be looking at the app a lot.,5
I like it It good to other people to chat😆😄,5

Undoubtedly one of the best terminal emulators around I downloaded this app last night and the awesome experience compelled me to throw in 5 stars. Everything works great if you want a mini debian based shell. The repo is limited but good enough for a lot of purposes. Keeping it handy will help out a lot  like practicing some coding with vi  VCS with git and ssh! Totally recommended if you are a Linux junkie.,5

Hands down the best podcast listening app I've found. Unlike several others I have recently gone through  I haven't had a single glitch out of this app so far  and I listen pretty much in an ongoing fashion. Further  the way it arranges episodes it exactly how I think- I can even rearrange the podcast episodes in to the order I want to listen to them. As close to podcast listening perfection as I have seen.,5
It takes the best photos I've ever seen by a cellular phone!!!!!! Amazing,5
Everything that I like from the other messaging apps I've used is in this app. There isn't really anything that I dislike about Telegram. It's perfect.,5

It plays most games great. Only issues I have is you have to change lt rt buttons to a and b to use in car games because the analog LT2 and RT2 wont let you use them. If you use LT1 and RT1 for brake and gas it wont work right because the original dreamcast used analog. Games i found that don't work are royal rumble  toy commander  ready to rumble 1 and 2  star wars racer  sega rally 2. Sonic adventure 1.,5

Good App But... Thanks to the developer for the response  looking forward to an update with my requested features in the near future. I manage multiple wordpress blogs(more than 50). My blogs serve as rss feeds for my mobile apps. so it's quite challenging remembering passwords to login and then logout for each of them. A multi-login WordPress app will be very useful in handling this issue  as all I'll have to do is sign-in once to each of them and then just switch users when I need to manage another blog. Thank you.,5

Hi are talking in the last two days after the,5
"2017/01/24 Android messed up again with 7.0! If they take away stuff  they need to provide a means of getting it back by allowing the user to grant access to it manually. It seems that the """"""""""""""""do no evil"""""""""""""""" doesn't apply to big brother Google anymore. :-((( I expect behavior like that from Apple  not from Google. 2016/04/15 Since I got android 6.0 installed  marshmallow  the selected color didn't show on the notification and since the frame is dark  and the dark colored graduating bars are dark too instead of light blue  and all is showing on a transparent notification bar where the image under it is dark  I couldn't see it at all. 5/7/2016 Nothing about this issue was addressed  so one star now. 9/3/2016 finally this issue was fixed.""""",5

Incredibly impressive work  I honestly didn't expect my rip of Ikaruga to run as well as it did. I'm looking forward to future progress!

Breanna Wonderful,5
Can't top the original Love to play this game and adore that it doesn't need to be online to play. I have played the spinoffs by others of this but all it feels like is they cheapen it by making things easier or tipped the balances with either new skills or elements.,5
Three words: absolutely love it!,5

The best Subsonic app. Period. Absolutely the best app to pair with your Subsonic. Great features  excellent UI  plenty of widgets  and frequent updates by a very involved Dev. Well worth the cost  so just buy it. My only wish is that the Dev would update the icon to a material design look to compliment Marshmallow. Small gripe though because it's the best SS app available.,5

I was about to walk right back in but something told me to look up  which i hardly ever do due to the annoying street light's  office light's  and the fuel stations light's.. There are entirely too many. So not a city gurl.. anyway i did a search.. And found this app and my world ws made new.. The stars i was looking at and trying to make out what they were were not stars at all.. But planets I so pleased. TY,5

Great game Simple but challenging. This game is not something you want to shove aside. If you've had any gaming experience in rouge or net hack you'll absolutely love this game. Playing through the game is worth it. And the challenging levels to every floor make it all most rewarding you made it to new floor. But the deeper you get the more you gain bits and pieces of the story line. In the end its the best game I've seen on android like this in a while,5

Does exactly what I wanted! Have stacks of 2nd hand books  and needed a catalogue to stop buying duplicates. The look-up series/author is also great for filling series gaps you've only found through the catalogue. Have recently found that using Google Googles as the barcode scanner no longer seems to work  perhaps due to recent move to Android 7-1-1? A shame  as have been using the app for over 2 years and scanned nearly 2k books into my collection! Changed to using Zxing scanner  and works perfectly again.,5
Still working for me Had this for years (since the evo 4g  just updated to lollipop  wiped my phone clean  and reinstalled  works perfectly to archive my texts into my email. You have to make sure your Google account is set to allow this program access  otherwise  quick and easy (backed up 300 messages in about 1 minute),5

Excellent! I Love Google/Google Play! Google Play has so many apps and I think 1 000's of them are Free! I don't think I have run into a time where I was looking for a specific app and found I had to pay for it. The Google office software is  for the most part  very compareable to other Office Suites. Although there are a few additions that should be added to use Sheets fully for Business and maybe home (cell size  etc...) Thank You Google for ALL your hard work!,5

Real News at Your Fingertips This is not the nightly news. This is not five minutes of glossed over world and national events with no background or explanation  then another five minutes of how eggs are suddenly bad for you again when yesterday they were the healthiest thing out there  and then five minutes of feel good stories because the world is falling apart  all sandwiched in between ExxonMobil commercials  BP propaganda about how they didn't actually ruin the gulf and Viagra commercials. This is real news and an amazing app.,5

Amazing! Does more than I wished! The best thing I ever found for my media files on the laptop is Kodi  formerly XBMC. A highly recommended app for your Kodi. I use Kodi for my 32inch LED TV to which I connect my laptop through an HDMI and Kodi along with this app reduces the cost of buying those HDMI streaming devices like Chromecast  Teewe  etc. And this remote app does give an awesome feeling of the so called wireless thing.,5

Great App/Responsive Developer I find this app very useful. I wanted a way to watermark my art invisibly. This is wonderful! At first  I had an issue trying to decrypt the messages.

First of all kudos for the ad free app! smoothest Zoom and scrolling. Like the low permission requirements. Used to take 20 seconds to load now it loads faster than the app opening animation after the update. Some caching and picture loading optimizations would make it the best! Right now it takes some time for the pics to show when you enter them and an album. (NEXUS 6P),5
Like it Love it,5
Realy good Defenitly 5 star app,5

Is this the stock Huawei gallery??? It's extremely similar  simple  useful  fast  organized  with surprisingly many useful updates. Best of all  it's free. Had no crash or other problems so far (+30day usage),5
Been using it since the very beginning of Android and while I've often looked around  this still remains the best email app for Android. Everything available for free  highly customizable and it's open source to top it off. Easy 5/5.,5

* update* could somebody make a mod with an over world/ town hub? tap to move  slide to scroll  pinch to zoom. its wonderfull to tell my guy to go to the other side of the map and have him stop if he encounters a monster and wait for instruction! yes its hard  sure you die alot~you never know whats around that next corner! The game play is sleek and fun and the interface is so smooth. I have a smaller screen and this works so well  i never want to go back to anything less than this intuitive system!,5
Nearly Perfect App Lots of puzzles  easy to understand interface  small size and unobtrusive use of resources. One of the best and most challenging puzzle games packaged in a great  lean app. Thanks!,5

Incredible! I have been using this app since 2010 when I first got my brand new Original Motorola Droid. It has never failed me. Ever. Works like a dream. I can cut the exact part of the song I want for my ringtone. Most ringtone apps give only the chorus but this app allows you to use that one line that means the most to you  or your favorite verse of that song that you love to dance to. There's no other app out there that works so perfectly. Love it. Download it. Now.,5

Great The saving page is the beat feature if this app it is great and everyone should have this app on their phone. I find it better than the web version.,5
This app helped me to track down a rogue app that was secretly monitoring my usage and throwing up many types of pop up ads when I was using the phone. That app would turn itself on for less than a second and go to sleep  leaving behind pop up ads which seemed to not have any connections to any running processes. OS Monitor allowed me to monitor the 'status' of running and sleeping apps on my phone and I was able to spot the dodgy behaviour of this app that Antivirus and Malware cleaners could not find. There are other uses for this app but right now  this single feature will be part of my Android tool kit.,5
Best out there. A solid app with constant updates and getting better every time.,5

I find myself coming back to this game over and over again. Everything other than your character selection is completely randomized  be warned though  if you die you restart the game ( beginning a new completely randomized game) so take your time and don't forget to use your items. Over the last 3 years I've been to the end level once. But haven't beat the game. Good luck,5

The benefits of this are   it will help the player to analyse well in every second and to stay focus !!! Fix this.. Thanks !!! No new game option for this latest version ..Sir pls.. add premove feature   rated game  and engine vs engine game.. sir pls.. for this coming christmas that was my wish !!!,5

Repaired APP Update 12 June 2015. I want thank whomever has corrected this app. This has returned to being a great app. This has returned to being a great way to tune in NPR stations nationwide  from Florida to Alaska and Maine to Hawaii. (Previous review) I can not get my local NPR station KTXK in Texarakana. Nor can I get live streams from WNYC WHYY WNPR. I don't know what the change in the latest update is but I have lost a lot of stations. (The APP has been corrected),5

Kernel Adiutor modified version by Yoinx I'm using a modified version of KA by Yoinx from XDA. I'm not sure my rating applies to the original version or not. I always used the original version before Yoinx modified it to work with the Nexus 6 B14CKB1RD Kernel built by R3V3NT3CH. Thanks for allowing Yoinx to use your application as a base. Your development skills are top notch.,5

This app is amazing! I've switched from Samsung to LG (2nd Galaxy phone died just weeks after warranty ran out :-( I had SMS & MMS backed up to my Samsung account but LG won't access it! Did a search  found this app. Was able to use my friend's Samsung Galaxy SIII to connect to my Samsung account and restore my texts. Then use SMS Backup+ to backup the texts to my gmail account....took awhile  about an hour (3800 SMS & about 750 MMS). The App creates a folder in gmail called 'SMS' and you can view/read all your texts there...but that's not the end! I also installed SMS Backup+ on my LG and backed up all the new texts (about 2 months worth  200 texts) to my gmail - and the app appended older texts from the same contact with the new texts (wow!!). Then went back to my LG and did a 'restore' (follow the simple directions) and voila! All my texts are in my LG phone (back to 2014) with the new ones combined with older ones - sweet! I'm impressed  thank you Jan Berkel :-) <3,5

Finally  a QuickPic killer. The dev is responsive to problems immediately. The permissions are kept to a minimum. 10 stars! Addition: I've seen a few comments lately about the amount of updates being posted. Be happy that the dev puts so much effort into the app. There are a lot of different manufacturers and configurations of phones (various launchers  rooted phones  etc..). I just submitted a bug report yesterday afternoon and got the fix for it this morning. Respect! I remain by my evaluation: 10 stars!,5

My favorite all around browser. Utilizes Google grade search algorithms  but without the tracking. It's also able to be used with Orbot  if you wanna get your proxy on. Icing on the cake is all of the interesting (well many are!) news stories to check out in the app  while you people do whatever it is you do with your time online. You get to pick only the available sources that you want. I usually have several browsers installed on my devices  but if I had to roll with only one  Duck Duck Go...you're it!!,5
Awesome,5

Working on over 50 requests (no I don't know him. I'm in the US  he's an Aussie (G'Day)! Totally flexible  maybe too flexible. Paid $100 for a PC app and this one is perhaps better. It's coordination with Good Reads doubles its usefulness. I just sent him a donation as he can't charge for it as he's Aussie.

"The most practical and efficient launcher I have ever used What can I say? I love the tiny download size  fast response time  and quick access to different functions. My only complaint is that sometimes shell commands like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""top"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""ifconfig"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" appear to run  but don't actually give me any information. This won't stop me from making this my default launcher though!""""",5

Amazing free aviation app for Android Nexus 5 running Android 6.0 Marshmallow  and Avare can't get past the registration screen. I can't tap anything to get it to continue and allow me to actually register  and it keeps telling me to register. Probably 5 stars whenever the developer gives this a compatibility update. EDIT: Speedy reply from the developer in my email. Had to go into Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Avare &gt; Permissions (grant all). That got it working as advertised! Great app  thanks for helping me solve this issue!,5
It works It does what it's design for and I can use it and that's all that matters to me.,5

Absolutely loving it! Brilliant swiss knife of a search engine. The inbuilt browser is capable and seamless. Respects privacy. The bangs are epic. Forget all other search engines  including Google. Just one quirk. There's no verb form for it. It's difficult to say I'll duckduckgo it. But I can definitely live with that. Great job guys. PS: the inbuilt tor support works effortlessly  provided you have orbot installed.,5
Downloading this is very good,5

Awesome game ! This is by far one of the best dungeon rpg  i ever play on this market. IT'S FREE  and don't have any pay to win sistem. I highly recommended this game to anyone that like a old style rpg like game  but there's some stuff that i hope the developer tweak tho. For example why not made it that when you level up  your hp and other negative buff is healed completely  and make the coin actually useful on low level dungeon  and add a skill tree so that we can notice more that the characters have grow stronger  etc,5

Hate reviews,5
Good,5
Works when tweaked properly: I had to keep tweaking settings for it to work well. Galaxy S7 Edge is my example. There are hella choices for rendering options and more. The trick is to configure screen resolution  frameskips  and emulated processor overclocking. Initially the default 100% psp's GHZ is choppy (audio too)  I use 200% psp's performance  achieving full intended speed on Grand Turismo. Battery drain is impressively low unless your display is bright and/or high resolution. I expect good newish phones to use this app well.,5
Can you make ps2 emulater,5
Awesome! Keep up the good work  please add more widgets for exchange email and Facebook perhaps,5

Stop whining! Google Apps need this to run! This is somewhat part of your system. It is needed for GCM and other cool stuff that apps can do. Advice: if you don't know what it is  do some research  before complaining.,5

Great! The loading (synchronizing) time could be a bit more efficient. Or perhaps not automatically when you open the app so that you do not need to wait for it. Another thing is that you cannot read comments when the app is syncing which is a bit annoying.,5

This app is just perfect! I have a motorola X style and with this software it can almost compete with my mirrorless camera. The details that can be captured with this is amazing. I understand so many algorithms are going on when i take a photo. Huge huge respect for all the developers and many many thanks for providing it free. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!,5

Excellent - and I've some suggestions for making it better! First of all - thank you! Lovely app. And a splendid undergraduate project. The detail is breath taking. It would be even better  tho  if one could have information on the number of iterations being performed. A simple counter would be adequate. Also  an optional grid for the (x y) axes would be helpful.,5

Reliable  works The app just works and I can rely on it which is important because it stores critical information.

This is the type of launcher u have been searching for the past six months. Now i've found it. The best launcher. Very intuitive. Sometimes the keyboard stop walking using this launcher.

Will make you love lock screen widgets! Update: You can now adjust the background opacity! Excellent work! Truly excellent work from a certified Googler! One suggestion I can give though is for the home screen widget. If you can add an option to remove the background  that would be great! Aside from that  if you have android 4.2 installed  there is no reason not to get this.,5

All issues resolved. Strictly adheres to the 2FA security model by disallowing exports and syncing. Ideal for security experts and other professionals who need perfect security  occasionally at the cost of convenience. Of all the compliant apps  though  this seems to be the most user-friendly; it fixes several UI/UX issues present in Google Authenticator.,5

Waaaay better than the stock Samsung camera App and that's saying alot since Samsung takes their cameras and camera Apps very seriously. I WON'T use another camera App (if I don't have to) again. Easy to use & has tremendous Pro features for a FREE App! My Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has never before taken such high & Pro quality photos & videos. You've earned ALL 5-Stars!! Please keep the updates coming.,5

Loving it  but ran into a big annoyance This emulator is everything a pokemon fan needs... But something strange happened. I can't reach the settings button anymore and I have no clue why?

Amazing widget! As others have said this is a MUST coming from iOS for those who are used to having all their notifications automatically display on their lock screen. This is even better than iOS because you can choose what notifications you want and leave out the ones you do not want. EDIT: My only suggestion is to make the ability for more extensions than 10. But it does not keep it from 5 stars. Plus the tiny 4mb RAM usage makes this app almost perfect.,5
Excellent Good app ,5

Battery Managed. This app aided me in discovering two separate causes of my previously terrible battery life. It made it possible for me to correct the issues and prove to myself that I am now maintaining the best battery life possible for my phone.,5
Literally the app I've been looking for! This concept of a launcher is radically awesome! Hope you continue to develop more features for this app 😀 Additional I'd really love to see if adding widgets could be possible and try adding some animations to how the app drawer opens and how the taskbar itself collapses like a receding animation maybe? 🤗,5

Note  does not work in 7.1.1. To those who are complaining  this does not work in 7.1.1 for the very simple fact that there is no such mode to enable. Google  our evil overlords  have deemed it fit to deprive us of such a luxury and thus have completery removed the hidden night mode from the latest beta. :(,5

Good app,5
After trying close to 15 browsers  this is my favorite I'm very glad to have found this broswer. I was frustrated to find the lg g4 came with chrome(which I'm not a fan of on mobile) in place of the reliable stock browser. I was looking for a broswer that delivered an experience close to the stock browser  and this delivers. Smooth scrolling  bookmarks easily accessible on the side  full screen mode  and great ad blocking make for the best web experience I have found. I would definitely recommend this broswer. Kudos to the developers!,5

I Used it. It worked Moto Razr with Moto G I tried to use it a couple of times before. But it worked this time. Its a brilliant concept. Do let me know if I can be of any help. The only problem was that there was a delay in relay of voice call from the host to the receiver. The Receiver's voice had a huge delay of more than 30 sec. Also  the broadcast message kept popping up. There wasn't any option to delete or mark as read. Great work! Cheers Sid,5

This camera is an upgrade  and it is now my default camera.,5

I used Top Task List constantly on my Windows phone and it was absolutely brilliant - and this is the closest thing I've found to replace it on Android. I can create categories for my tasks and create all kinds of reminders  set due dates  priorities and link it to different calendars in Google Calendar. In the list view it's easy to read with a simple design that has just the right amount of formatting so that the design isn't taking up half the screen space. I just got the location plugin so now I can be reminded of things at my usual places. I love that. Highly recommended!,5

Best ebook reader. Period. Sometimes I get the itch to try a different ePub/TXT/PDF reader on Google Play  only to find out it is inferior to FBReader. I uninstall that one  and come back to FBReader. This should be the gold standard that ALL eBook readers should ascribe to.,5

I really like this Bible app. The capability of using the Greek and Hebrew dictionaries is amazing!,5
Love it!! I've been playing this game since it was new and even though it can be challenging   I still play it regularly ( min. 2 hours a day ). Patience  stubbornness and adaptivity are needed to get to the later levels or beating to game. If you die just try again and learn the behavior of the enemies in-game so you can hopefully beat the game yourself.,5
Ok Never mind that this is a great 🕙,5
Great implementation Seems flawless. I've been using the PC version for years (thank you)  and this Android version is a welcome find. The ability to update the database on my phone is also very welcome.,5

I love the game and all of its mechanics! I have some requests though it may just be because I suck: 1) I think more balancing is needed regarding the chances of what kind of glyph you will get from an arcane stylus. I just get the ones that root or slow the player too often. 2) Vampire bats seem to take rather high amount of health from me and seem to dodge too well too. I don't know  it seems unfair and gets on my nerves. 3) The sniper doesn't have nearly as many advantages compared to the warden  and the assassin to the freerunner. 4) Health potions and food are rarer to come upon. Especially approaching boss level depths. 5) I think access to rings need to be improved. I have frequent games where I do not come across an artefact or other item to fill my other 2 equip slots. And the variety of ring functionality can really change one game from another  if only they weren't so rare. 6) Please nerf the skeleton blasts  in most cases there aren't any means to kill them at a distance and their blasts are rather high for a low level player in my opinion.,5

"Must Have App On an old phone I had a crap load of texts that I didn't want to delete but had to. I went online for an app suggestion to back all of them up and your app was top rated. My last phone took a dump on me and I couldn't find your app on the market. Ended up downloading the apk online somewhere. I love it that much. When I first installed it to this day it has backed up 9815 texts. I never had any problems but every once in awhile I get an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I/O ERROR"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or something like that. What is that all about?""""",5
Thanks for a nice  clean  small and open-source app made for improving system usability. Please change version number when updating app. Please add to your todo list: 1. Ability to reorder pinned items manually. 2. Option to reduce icon size of recent items  so more can fit without scroll. 3. Show the search box for any device. 4. (impossible?) Resize app's windows so taskbar don't overlap them  like the real taskbar in Windows.,5

Superb Though I suspect it being a little difficult for some  as it seems to throw you in the deep end with deck efficiency  and when managing something of large sizes it's always best to do it right first and not remodel all your cards after. The app runs butterfly smooth  no fault in it. I like the gestures for single handed simplicity.,5

Nice new version,5
"Excellent subsonic app A.very good subsonic client - easy to use  good layout  reliable. My only gripe is the lack of support for multiple tags in the same field  i.e. tags separated by some separator  for example """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""jazz;free jazz;experimental"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as the genre tag  which should result in the song being found under all of the three genres listed  or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sunn O)));Boris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as the artist field  which should result in the song (and the whole album of the song) being listed under both the artists """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sunn O)))"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Boris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". This is the way squeezeserver operates and really should be the standard  but I am yet to find a mobile music streaming app that allows this basic functionality. Edit: Changed the rating to 5 stars after a developer reply explaining that lack of multiple tag/tag separator issue is a limitation of the subsonic server itself and not due to app design.""""",5

However  since the really good & small MP3 players aren't being made anymore (or the newer line of Sansa players aren't as good anymore)  I was looking for an audiobook player app for my smartphone. And thanks to Material Audiobook Player  I found it. It's good  no-nonsense  and perfectly sufficient for my needs. Thanks  Paul!,5

This has nearly every feature under the sun. Its Achilles' heel is there is no way to sync all the information pertaining to tasks across devices or at least automatically back it up to the likes of Drive or Dropbox. Although it can sync with Google tasks  it can't edit Google Task categories  and most information pertaining to tasks can't be synchronised and backup is strictly manual. Also  comments and timer logs on a task seemingly can't be deleted.,5
Awesome App.,5

Useful and intuitive I was desperate in my search for alarms; since my last HTC one m8 updated the original alarm on here seems to have lost sound. After unsuccessful downloads of other alarms  I can recommend this application.,5
5 stars because it definitely does what it needs to. I do wish there was a different option though like a long press on one volume key only because pressing both at the same time can be a little awkward. Especially since alot of modern phones have a quick toggle in the drop down menu.,5
Google play What you want they try to please,5
FOSS at it's finest I can only strive to be good enough to work on it someday. If you checkout the github  there's constant interaction between collaborators. Oh  and there's Chromecast support.,5

FINALLY a Decent Envelope App!! I have tried kinds of envelope budgeting apps and I have lost count of how many of them I have uninstalled. This one is clear  easy to set up and sooooo not complicated. You add your money to the envelopes and enter what you spent. BAM! Done. No figuring your budget based on when you get paid and all that complicated stuff. Just you and envelopes. Plus if you have a question or problem  the creator of the app will actually reply to you and very quickly. Thsns so .much for making this app!,5

Instead i'm using the on screen micro icon and say """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cheese"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Sometimes it thinks i'm saying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Jesus"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ?! Also there is a lighting flicker when under 50Hz lights or LCD's here in France.

Bubble Level This app is great! Since I like to think of myself as a guy on the up & up  the bubble level helps me keep my cool during tough decisions. Last week I used it to help me make a level headed decision to go ahead a rip that fart in a crowded elevator and blame it on the retarded kid with the helmet on. I was unsure what to do but this app helped straighten out the situation! Able to calmly walk out the elevator without an angry mob chasing me as is what usually happens. All thanks to the level app!,5
Love it,5

"There was nothing quite as edifying as thumbing through an Encyclopedia Britannica. One learned lots of """"stuff"""" randomly and if you got bored  you just let it go and came back to it later and learned more """"stuff"""" randomly. This is not as satisfying as the old E.B. but it'll do.",5
Its important,5

Sometimes apps don't cut it... ...compared to being able to use a command line. So glad to be able to have SSH in a real linux environment without having to chroot or use a client that doesn't properly interpret keystrokes.

NPR App I enjoy listening to NPR on the radio because they bring very interesting and great topics to discuss. It's one of the few places I actually trust to get receive information from because so many other radio and news outlets are conservative owned and they will only tell you false information. NPR distinguishes itself from the rest for these reasons and they are pleasant to hear on the way home from work or class.,5

Google is awesome. Have a suggestion..... Right now there is one password for my google account. I think having individual passwords for specific google service would be very helpful.

Good App Easy to use. Many customization settings. I'm in construction and use this so I don't worry about lost receipts. Also useful for personal. I'll always have a brand new receipt for returns to store. I have also emailed the developer about syncing across multiple devices and he said he was working on it. Buying full version to support developer. Good job.,5

Excellent app. Seems amazingly accurate. A great way to get my kid interested in astronomy/science. We saw what I thought was Mars (reddish color) but Skymap identified it as Betelgeuse. We googled Betelgeuse and found out we were actually looking at a red giant star over 600 light years away. Alot of fun for us.,5

Amazing! When I saw this emulator in the store I just couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing... An (almost) fully working Dreamcast emulator for my phone?!? And it's free?!? I have a Nexus 5 and I must say that Reicast works amazingly well  at full speed! although there are graphical glitches here and there  you have to consider that it's still in alpha. Kudos to the developers for making such a great Dreamcast emulator! And don't forget that this is only going to get better and better!,5

I was skeptical at first but I changed my mind when I tried the app. It does work offline and has numerous features that are simply exceptional. It's better than the free version  for sure. It would've been better  had there been an official manual or instructional video on how to utilize it.,5

I even use it to scan qrcodes with WiFi connection details  works like a charm!,5

I dont have to go back to the home acreen to switch apps now  which is a plus because doing that can erase text fields and other things. 5/5 just for the fact that it can draw OVER the UI!,5

Great email program 5 years ago I helped a coworker move over to K-9 when she had some problems with the built-in email app on her Android phone and an email server I didn't manage. It did a great job where the other failed and saved us all a lot of headaches. Fast forward to October 2015  when I got my first Android phone  and I'm facing a similar situation. Didn't take me long to remember K-9. I installed it on my phone and I haven't looked back. It does a great job and is very customizable. Thanks!,5

Great free app Can take some time to get used to  but for some very flying - or as a moving map - great. Found some issues - POU airport runways 6/24 are listed as 7/25 on the map runway extensions - yes there is a turf runway 7/25 but for a Class D airport it should list the main 6/24. But  a pilot shall always be thinking... 5 stars for good work,5

Re-mounted the card  and voila  I can access all my music and photos from music player and gallery  without having to do anything else. I did have to use colornote's """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""restore back up""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  but that's ok  my notes and lists were all there.""""",5

EDITORS CHOICE: Loop - Habit Tracker No Ads. No paid add-ons. A clean  tidy interface and great selection of widgets. Easy to use to track habits (or other regular activity). This should be a Google Play Store Editors Choice recommendation. Thank-you to the developer - I don't think anyone would begrudge a yearly pop-up asking for an app review or donation towards continued development of the app.,5

LG Mach  ICS 4.04: Great utility made even better Excellent for learning choral music on-the-go  without the weight of my book  with a good stereo headset---also works great piped through speakers at home. I recommended this app to everyone who does part-singing. The option to show lyrics and measure numbers already present is a plus. My community chorus midis are notated that way. Instead of coloring the notes  the option to highlight my part by the line  like a highlighter  as well as the words  with different colors for each  would be better.,5

Love this app but... I've used this app with all my previous phones. It makes everything look so much more clean and fluid. Unfortunately  it doesn't work that well in android 5 and up due to the universal status bar transparency in most apps. I still give it five stars though because it's an essential app if you're running anything below 5.0,5
Love it,5

Great idea behind this! Having a widget that allows several apps to have access to the widget  therefore all displaying in one place is such a useful idea. It's a shame that more apps than are currently available can't display on the widget. Suppose the app dev can't be blamed for that though.,5

[Update] Well done. Except bug. Anything else? Clapping my paws. Things greatly changed in the past several upgrades. Features become handy  UI got a overhauled update. As I said before  if you have big.Little struct CPU  go and get this. However  under interactive mode  big cores freq table editing is not functioning. Hope there's gonna be a fix. For the UI  I don't get people why complaining about it. Till I checked their accts  and found out that low-end users with low range phones are having great issues. (Maybe old one looks more professional?) Cheers!,5

Best app This is one of the best apps for cataloging my books. I would recommend this app to everyone that is a avid book collector. I have over 200 books and not only is east to add  maintain  and keep up to date but it goes good with goodreads another wonderful app.,5
The Best Superuser app for Android! I like this over SuperSU coz this is Open Source. It's got many more features than old Superuser and SuperSU. It's pre installed in CyanogenMod and many other ROMS  integrates with Settings looks good on tablets and many more.,5
Still works like a stock gallery app. Only the app size is no longer less than 1Mb 😂 rest. One gripe after hiding or deleting a folder or file auto refresh takes back to the top. Then you have to scroll down again.,5

Awesome job  5 stars! ♥ I ♥L.O.V.E.♥ this Kodi remote. It's a whole lot easier than grasping for your mouse & keyboard every time you want to watch something. I've been using the Yatse remote  but recently tried Kore & I liked it so much that I immediately switched apps- for good!!! Nice job  developers- Thank you for an incredible application.*°,5

Suggestions It will be good realization of searching articles between several zim files. I mean for instance I have english and russian wikipedia's zim files. When I am searching something I get only in russian or english. Or It will be good changing article language directly in the article instead of opening another zim file and do everything again. :) Thanks.,5
Magnificent This app accurately counts my calls  text and data to give me a good idea of how I am using my plan. I have no major complaints  just that it can be a bit more customizable; namely  the ability to frequently change when my bill cycle starts.,5

It works for me. Came across this app while looking for assistance with sleeping. I had not heard of binaural therapy before and had no idea what to expect  however  it really does help me fall asleep. The instructions say to use headphones but I can never fall asleep with them on so just use a small speaker setup which seems to work fine for me.,5
Awesome app I love it! Because it does not track me like Google.,5
Awesome App My 5th different android and I've had it in them all. Too good to ignore or abandon. Does the job in a simple and effective way,5
I've tried a bunch of the paid star gazing apps  and all made the simple job of identifying the visible elements in the night sky way too difficult. Sky Map gets the job done perfectly - showing all the info you need and even constellation info without bogging you down in useless info or a cluttered/overly flashy user experience. And it's free. Brilliant app.,5

Cool,5
I've been looking for a decent gallery app for my HTC 10 ever since HTC started forcing users over to the Google photos app.. side loading the old gallery was an option but the only control on the SD card was as a viewer so you could not copy/past to the SD card or edit photos once they were saved there. It was a massive pain in the backside. This is a simple app with few permissions needed. There is some basic customisation too for the UI which is a nice touch.. and most importantly no ads,5
Good Nice,5

Great game Been playing for a while now. Seen a couple updates. This is a grind game. Takes time. Well built with divergent story lines. If you want a game that is a time investment  this is it. Building your character requires direction. Only serious gamers need apply. Oh and as for updates  they take a while to happen but are usually large. Got ideas or suggestions or see a problem  google the forum community.,5
So great! Thanks.,5
Easy to set up  works perfectly! I don't rate apps. Ever. But I'm rating this one  because it's that awesome. My phone turns it's volume on when I wake up  off when I get to work  on during my lunch hour  off when I go back to work  on when I'm driving home and off when I go to bed.. except on weekends when it's on all day until bedtime. I set it up to do all this in less than 5 minutes and now my phone does everything on it's own  thanks to this app! Trust me  this is one of those things you didn't know you needed!,5

Out of all the pretty looking launchers  this one is the fastest and fairly nice looking when you turn on background. As long as you use a mostly uniform background it works nicely. There is a bug where you can't use multiple apps with the same name  but that's about it.,5

Great but lacking a detail This alarm clock is great  I love how easy it is to change the alarm time. But every time I change the alarm time I have to tap AM. I would like a setting to have it permanently in the AM to not have to confirm every day that I'm a normal person that wakes up in the morning.,5

Best in class! I've been using this app from the start and it's gotten better and better with every update! At first I dismissed the modarchive search and download since it didn't work  but recently I found out the problem was with the location I set for my mod directory and now it works! It would be nice to have access to the genre filters to make it more useful. Of course  every time there's an update I always check if a couple of my problematic mods got fixed  but now I think I will send these in myself.,5

Good app I have been using this app for a couple of years does everything you need it to. Beware I've noticed with all apps of this type. After updating the app it stops working you ha e to go back to open it up and manually back up the first time. Which is annoying! I had 2 months worth of text to back up this last time.,5

The way to send pics or vids or music  not bad. It makes things easy. Also great great great smileys and stickers.^^ Edit: With @gif and @gamee we sometimes forget that we're supposed to talk strategy  our channel turned to fun zone😂  but it's for the alliance channel only  because in the guild alliance we're a little more serious  sometimes😀,5

Even handles large hosts files This app has nothing to do with any game  it changes the routing of host names only  you need to know exactly what you are doing  and your phone needs to be rooted first. I have flashed the 'Mother of all add blocking' hosts file  which is too big for most text editors on Android to handle. But this app works fine  even search is fast.,5

Love it! I really like it  the puzzles are fun  and best of all  IT'S FREE. But I'm dumb and some of the puzzles I can't get the hang of  even if I read the instructions 50 times. But anyway  It's great fun  and definitely a wonderful app. Keep it up! 😊,5
I can get any game I want!,5
"2 great features you'll love 1. Dsub properly mutes sound (unlike Subsonic which mutes Waze too) when Waze is trying to give driving directions. 2. Dsub shows a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Root"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" entry for videos  instead of ignoring top folder movies like Subsonic.""""",5

Great game Nice  old school game that is pretty hard. I seem to run out of food too often (unless I get to the store). One minor bug: about 10% of the time the wand maker's target is in a locked room with no key. Also  making the game more difficult at night just means I don't play when I have the best availability.,5

If the devs could update it so that it was mobile viewing mode but automatically switched to desktop mode for messages  it would be much more streamlined.""""",5

Works Perfectly! I lost Night Mode on my Nexus 5X because once the preview build was updated to final Android 7.0 I factory reset the phone. This app made it show right back up for me. I was even able to uninstall this app after hitting enable. I decided to donate a dollar to the developer because this was a life saver for me. The night mode was the best new feature in the preview  and I really started to rely on it.,5
Very Good. Thank you.,5

Very very very anyeonghansayo,5
Very good.,5
People need to be patient! The app needed to be updated to match the new style guides  and I  for one  think it looks much better now! Of course there are a few glitches here or there but the developer is responding quickly. I think sheer volume of negative responses demonstrates how many people rely on this app every day  and let's remember it's free without any ads or anything. Let's all be a little more patient when we notice a small issue. I can guarantee the dev won't leave us with a broken app for long (and in my experience it's far from broken) Further  if you're having an issue with a specific puzzle  I can virtually guarantee it's because that source has changed something. When that happens this app's dev has always been very quick to respond whenever possible (it's not always within his power).,5
It is very useful,5
Amazing app  I'm running,5
Excellent. I used to have something like that as a native feature in my previous phone (I owned a LG G4) and I missed it a lot when I moved to another brand  but now that I found this I'm really amazed that it's quite better than the one I had. Just excellent!,5

Works beautifully!

You can download music/playlists on to your device via the remote and all. :-) No Advertising Bollicks  and it just does exactly what it's supposed to do  beautifully! Thank you so much  to the developer/s! :-),5

"Out of all the games that have been released for Android  I find myself mostly returning to my SNES emulator and SCUMMVM! Playing these classic game tickles my nostalgia button like nothing else can. Tip for those not happy with the controls: on the main menu go into OPTIONS &gt; MIDI tab and then tap the """"""""""""""""Mixed Adlib/MIDI mode"""""""""""""""". Exit the app and launch it again. This option changes the controls from touchpad-like to direct input. I personally prefer this mode. The only thing I'd wish they'd change is an option to make the font and button size larger on the main screen  as it's hard to select the small buttons with my chubby fingers. AWESOME APP!!!""""",5

But I'll appreciate your help more  if i can load credit from the terminal  hide the android notification bar and also display my ROM. Thank you. And also a security pass lock before operating the terminal will be very welcome,5
This app is exactly what I have been looking for. I have tried other apps that offer bits and pieces of system admin tools  and they were not great. This one just gives me what I need: a bash prompt and the ability to easily install various components with apt. As a bonus  I also get a nice python 3.6 system to use as I need  and a sshd server to connect to my phone from my other systems.,5
Nice App,5

"Finally found the launcher I was looking for This was just the launcher I was looking for. One flaw with Android is that in order to open up a new app you have to return to the home screen. That's too many taps. Home Button Launcher (HBL) resolves this issue beautifully. And while other home button swipe-up launchers I checked out offer this feature  the UI and screen customizations in HBL are just better: You can sort apps  control the size of app icons and text  create tabs  change the order of your tabs as well as swipe between them  which is a smart use of Android gestures. I also checked out full-OS launchers like Action Launcher  but none of those let you launch an app while in another app like HBL does. The only bug I've come across is when you select """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""No title bar"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" under Settings; when you do that  the Settings button disappears along with the title bar and you can't back to it.""""",5

Absolutely indispensable app to save hours of Your life! Simple  but impossible to live without once you try it. You missed one HUGE improvement though. The app is small so the best way to implement it is to let it sit in the background and switch the remote keyboard on when it receives a TELNET connection on port 2323. This way I could just telnet in and start typing instead of having to open the app and select the remote keyboard.,5

Add a way to schedule messages and it's perfect! I love the home screen and everything about it. The customization options for each contact  with changing the color of individual conversation  and option to change text and call sounds right from the conversation window. You guys are the bomb!

Much better than stock Subsonic All told  DSub performs MUCH better than the standard SubSonic player. Different features aside  playback is smoother  caching of songs is more transparent  offline playback works better. It appears to be under much more active development than the standard Sub player  so the $2 price tag is actually going toward something substantive.,5

Good apps indeed.,5

Great app! Super accurate and easy to use. Love it!,5
oke Iyes,5
Best app for messaging,5
Great app  I use it along with Tasker to automatically connect to my VPN anytime I connect to any WiFi besides my own. I have been using nearly daily for over a year now  on 2 phones and 2 tablets (after upgrades). I finally had my first issue  which took about 3 minutes to correct. Recently after upgrading the app on my Note5  the app would constantly crash. Since it was working fine on my Tablet  I decided to re-install with the intent of contacting the developer for help. The re-install fixed whatever the issue was however  and my VPN settings were still there after the re-install  so I did not have to put them back in. Results may vary of course.,5
Your tool ROCK!!!!!,5
Awesome  simple  open source.,5
Yha Buat main WW hehe,5
Is very necessary,5
Works fine How good and EMU and the ROMs run depend on your device  but even my low end $30 phone can use it okay. Some games run a lil slow but that happens with most stuff.,5
Thumbs up Really nice. Easy to use and nice themes.,5
Better than WhatsApp,5
Favorite since day one Have had this app on all 7 of my android devices. Love it! Never used another ereader and never will. Keep it up devs!!! One suggestion. Why don't you include pinch to zoom? It would be much easier to set the desired text size in this fashion.,5
For the most part  this is a wonderful app. I use it to get to sleep at night  and it works better than literally anything else  including medication. However  the few times it didn't work in the first 15 minutes  I began to feel like a character in a Don't Hug Me I'm Scared Video. Other than that  which is more a problem with me than with this  fantastic.,5

How to make simple apps elegant! I used to use Habit Bull. But with a change of phone had to upgrade to the new version. And guess what? More than 5 habits means using a paid version! Why? Simple apps should be easy to use  elegant  with no need for Internet   no ads and no upgrades. The best apps are a pleasure to use and don't distract or irritate. This definitely falls in that category! Thanks. The only extra option I'll need is weekly habit (eg Every Monday).,5

I used the old XBMC Remote for a long time and thought I would look for a better one. Maybe one has a mute button for streams that have commercials? This is it!! The more I use Kore the more awesome functionality I find. It's like a surprise with every swipe. I'm at a loss to find any drawbacks here... Amazingly simple interface  very intuitive  graphics of music play on the home screen in a neat little box  totally cool. For me though... loving the mute button!!! I'm still stunned every time I use Kore my new remote for KODI Rock the house!,5
Really does its job Works very smoothly. Couldn't be better.,5

"Great app This app works great. All of the features work as promised  and there are no annoying popups. Stay away from Crystal camera which is a stripped-down copy of this and other apps and even warns you """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Test OPEN CAMERA before using at weddings"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" on their instructions/description page because they don't even have the sense to change the app name 2 Crystal camera in the instructions when they plagiarize someone else's work!""""",5

This app + Kingston Office ! View  open  edit  create  save any document either from Microsoft office formats and OpenOffice formats and PDFs also. Exactly what I was looking for - lightweight app for viewing and editing OpenDocuments. It takes 5 3 MB of storage - fantastic. I have downloaded AndrOpen Office before  it was big (cca 50MB) and it was no good for my phone (4'')  it didn't fit on screen and it wasn't well optimalized for android (interface almost like PC version and zooming was wierd),5

Amazing. You can fine tune the audio to suit your needs. You don't just get white  pink or brown noise  you can get an entire spectrum. I suffer from Tinnitus so the ability to create an audio signal that I can use with my tinnitus and produce sounds that really do help me to sleep. I would give it more than 5 stars. It would be nice to be able to save an audio signal to an mp3 file of maybe up to an hour?,5

Makes Home Business a Breeze I love this app because I have a small business and it allows me to keep a low overhead while allowing me to be able to create the same expense reports big businesses do. I recently upgraded to a new phone however the app only allows you to export data and not import data. Now all my reports are gone inside the app on my new phone. Is there a fix for this? Help!,5
Kiran kumbhar,5

Sangat Penting .........,5
Awesome update First one to get root,5
Loved it Totally rad no root really simple,5
Love it Everything is perfect. Maps are small enough that they don't kill you devices memory. Only wish the app gave you the option to save data on say a SD card to make more space. With 90 % of the us stuff downloaded takes just under 3gbs.,5

Bekar,5
Awesome... Open source  no ads great!!!!!,5
Update everything,5
Very Impressed I have to say well done. Although I am ignorant of the technology your app deserves 5stars for the idea alone. My only suggestion perhaps a little more user friendliness with regards to not keeping the encrypted images in a separate labeled folder and maybe some way of making app invisible. I'm really very impressed.,5
I really like playing this old favorite.,5
Whatsapp who? This app is waaay better than Whatsapp  which I use with people that don't have Telegram. The stickers are the good s**t  but it lacks calls. Would give it a 7/5 if possible,5

This emulator runs perfectly on my device  I've had to enable the frame limiter as i was tripling the FPS in Sonic Adventure 2 x3 The controls however  make this unplayable! 90% of the time the buttons don't respond  the d-pad and analogue stick are fine though. Please sort this as it's the only let down.,5
Loved it Amazing,5
Good,5
Superb for Many Reasons Superb because: 1. It is not a 50MB Ap that eats away your memory  space and processing power. 2. It doesn't take away all your personal and private data  so you feel more safe. 3. It has some great features for both photos and video. I even like your Flat Picture Profile. Keep up the good work,5

Works great now Crashes everytime I try to play something.... very responsive disabling the sonic media player in the settings menu made all the difference.,5
Still my most played and enjoyed version of pixel dungeon  however  unlike other versions  you can't edit the saves for some reason. You used to be able to.,5

Awesome terminal man Truly great work  I occasionally SSH into my workstation to do stuff if I can't put don't feel like accessing it directly. It also has me somewhat interested in Android development  a truly magnificent piece of work. I can't thank you enough.,5

This app has been a life saver. Been using this app since the original android G1. I can't understand why phones don't have this standard and built in. Makes them all look stupid. But this app is perfect and simple. Nice to see updates coming out too to show devs are still on top of it.,5
Just wat I wanted,5
OK,5
Minimal and effective A beautiful app with a clean user interface  that does exactly what you think. Keeps track of your habits. Perfect if you don't want to be overloaded with features.,5

Nice app,5
Bubble levels Surprisingly good  would recommend.,5
Awesome Look at all these idiots giving 1 star just because the app stopped working due to Google changing its website. This app is amazing and it's completely free! Maybe the developer is sick  on holidays or away for a funeral? Even if not  you have no right to complain.,5
lovely,5
A+ model for other apps! Accuracy depends on quality of calibration. IMHO. I have used this magnificent Level App many times without ever being disappointed. Calibrated very carefully the first time and it has continued to remain accurate in subsequent checks. Thank You to the creator for a free ad free app that doesn't make me feel as if I have sacrificed my precious privacy!!!,5
Light fast awesome So many options- it's great! If only it had a widget.,5

"Fantastic. This is what the official Logitech SB Touch app should have been. The controls are very responsive. Using the volume buttons to control the squeezebox volume is a no-brainer but why didn't Logitech app designers think of that? Just in case anyone is wondering  there's a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""download"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option in the playlist page which you can use to copy any song in the playlist to your device (music folder). Just press the little triangle beside the song you want to copy and choose """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""download"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". A widget would be a great enhancement to an already awesome app. Thanks very much for making this great app!""""",5

Unique I like humble game devs who just like to make fun games and share them with the rest of the world with no ads or anything. I see other comments complaining about little things (like item degredation) when in the end people should take that as a challenge and see if they can win. Keep making games and I'll keep playing them!Go watobou studios!,5

"4.8 stars if I could! Excellent camera app... Best I've found so far. Why? It's basic  straight-forward and FREE! MAIN REASON) It only takes a photo AFTER it focuses!! My Lenovo takes a LONG time to finally focus and often changes when you press the shutter. It's really annoying. This app. avoids that and takes a quality photo every time as it locks the focus before it takes the photo. Brilliant... The only app. I've seen do this so far. Improvement Possibilities... 1) I had NO luck at all with the audio triggered shutter... Even shouting! Could we have the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Peace sign fingers"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" with a timer  please? 2) Could you put the HDR button on the main screen? I use it a lot if outside. Thank you so much. Loving it so far.""""",5

Great little app! I've been using this for 6 months and it keeps accurate fuel economy. No  you don't have to fill it to the brim. Fill it until it stops should be good enough. You can do partial fills and it still remains accurate but make sure you don't select full tank when doing a partial.,5

Convenient Cross-device syncing (unsecured) and desktop clients make this a perfect fit for my needs. Encrypted chats (which do of course not sync between devices) give peace of mind when I have to send sensitive information to someone. Auto destruct helps keep said info or of the hands of thieves even if I lose my device. And all of this is easy to use on all platforms. Perfect.,5

I'm still playing it. Very challenging. Still don't know what I'm doing after playing it for a week. Should come with instructions on items. I get you have to identify them but it's kind of adds another layer of needless difficulty. Should add an easy mode and hard mode instead. Just my opinion. edit: just found other versions of the game. Changed reviews to give 5 stars.,5
It's amazing! Simple app  self explanatory and does exactly what I wanted it to do which is calibrate my motion sensors. Somehow Samsung botched my Grand Prime sensor calibration and it was a nightmare trying to play motion sensor enabled games. I don't know why would anyone remove the option to calibrate sensors  dumb move by samsung. But thanks for the app you saved me guys! :D,5

Perfect for teachers As a teacher I was finding it difficult to keep my personal books separated from the classroom books. This app has helped solve that problem. I've tried the scholastic app that is similar to this  but they were missing several of their own books on it. Since switching to this app I have found it easier to keep track of my personal books I have in the classroom for my students. I also like that you can add multiple copies of the same book to the library on the app. Another feature similar apps lack.,5

I am tired to update this app from google play store,5
Fantastic This is my favorite browser on Android. Great work!!! I've seen a lot of apps get ruined because the developers don't know when to stop adding feature after feature. This app is light  fast has ad blocking and a sensible well thought out UI. PLEASE DONT RUIN IT BY TRYING TO ADD EVERY FEATURE UNDER THE SUN.,5

Have new Letv Le Max 2 snapdragon 820 and my battery life was HORRIBLE! The phone would go down 10% per hour under low useage. I change the CPU speed down to 1.4ghz and now goes down 2% per hour. Thank you so much!,5
Great service. Fixed bug quickly 2016: once bug was reported  developer fixed bug quickly. 2 Star Review May 2016: Can't get voice navigation to come up on my Nexus 6P  so almost useless now (I've made comment on Github). Quiet routes much safer than Google Maps. I've figured out how to show rental bike places. 5 Star Review 2015: Strap phone to my arm and it talks me through the quiet back streets of London. Wish there was better integration with rental bike places showing empty slots near destination.,5
With proper use of custom addons it can be used as a better and cleaner substitute of notification bar. It drasticly changes the usage of the lockscreen.,5

It's the best literally I've tried all the apps for rhyming and it's simply the best. Hat's off to UI development  it makes the app the most efficient and best in its class. Although just like other websites and apps you can't find all the rhyming words  it still depends on your vocabulary and wordplay ability. After all writing a song is an art and it should be pure?,5
Great apl Easy to set up and that's it it automatically back up on its own,5
Like it  works fine. Maybe it is a good idea to update the app every hour? But I prefer weekly  since I intergrade it in the ROM on this low memory Elephone G4,5

Ow Hi,5
4 star for the widget-- slick  useful & shows a lot of data in one view. Better than MiniStocks since it adds scrolling on to. Love it so far. I'd like to give 5 stars  but the indices are still not showing up on widget  Example ^GSPC (edit: this is fixed now  so changing to 5 stars). Tried old & new API options  same result.,5
"Simple and does what it says Allows you to use any computer and connect it via telnet to your phone. Some instructions on how to use telnet in the apps help would be appreciated though. But I figured it out. (Open telnet client. In telnet type """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""o [ip address of phone] [port number (2323)]"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Press enter. If you set a pswd type that and your in. Then type on ur computer keyboard and it shows in your phone. )""""",5

Hey,5
Gets the work done In a cleanest way possible. You do not want your tool to become a burden in itself. Many thanks for the dev team!,5
Excellent app  stop hating on this This app works very well for its purpose and deserves 5★. If you don't wish to use it then it can be disabled on your device and will use zero RAM as it does not run  and you will never be asked yo update this app in the Play Store. The factory installed app base will still occupy &lt; 5 MB storage which is acceptable. Please stop rating 1★ because you haven't been bothered to do help yourself and let the ratings here reflect an actual assessment of the app's deficiencies and proficiencies.,5

Updated @ 2.5 Months: Easily The Best! After auditioning numerous apps late last year  I'm now at 2.5 months of actual use with Smart Receipts Pro. I'm pleased to report 0 issues! I operate a sole proprietorship  so I need reliable and efficient business tools to save time and hassle. Smart Receipts was the only app that met my needs. Other reviews touting outstanding support were critical in my decision making (and proved to be 100% accurate). Developer has many enhancements on the drawing board  which is important for any app. Go Pro!!,5

It is as best as Adobe Reader and even better.... Lots of book readers are so much repelling and awful with their stupid reading limitations and dumb navigation concept that one may come to hate reading books on Android in general. It is only this fabulous app that makes reading enjoyable that you don't have to jump from one book reader to another to meet books' format. Thanks a lot to its bright developers.,5

When I looked for an ereader to install on my ASUS Phonepad this was the first app which I tried and since then I didn't try anything else. I installed it on my PC as well. What I like about it is its easy to use interface and the fact that it recognized all my e-books. At first I was unhappy that I couldn't read my PDF books in it  but then I installed the PDF plug-in and now I use this app for all my books.,5

Dates  amounts  titles and custom notes are fast to make or modify when needed. I love I can create job names to keep my costs separate. Five stars easy.,5
qqpp,5
Very useful.,5
Great app This is a great app for playing classic point and click adventures. The best emulator on the Google Play Store. By default  direct touch mode is turned off and its not apparent how to turn it on. Go to 'options' then 'midi' and make sure 'mixed adlib/midi mode' is checked then restart Scummvm and direct touch should be enabled.,5
"Very smooth and smart UI Simply the best of the free podcasts players out there. It doesn't have a splashy UI or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""fancy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" extra features -- just the podcasts you want. Easy to stream or download. Unlike some plays who use their own databases or RSS feeds  this one pulls straight from Apple podcasts! No more will your favorite podcast be unavailable to you  if they upload to iTunes (almost everyone does)  you'll have perfect updated access to it. I recommend this player to anyone new or old to podcasts.""""",5

Npr The best news from around the world..,5
IT HELPT ME ON Pokemon go,5
Absolutely love it! My favorite features are automatic music pausing on laptop when call is incoming and really seamless shared clipboard. Don't be discouraged by 'KDE' in name  I'm using it on Fedora 24 with GNOME  it was in repositories and most features work. I couldn't get phone icon & stats with indicator-kdeconnect to work properly  but no biggie.,5

EXCELLENT Z Interpreter! This is the BEST interactve-text shell program I've run across that is for Android. It is fast  responsive  intuitive and makes interactive fiction that much more fun because of one-key entries and icon selection actions. You don't even have to use the keyboard for most of your action commands. It is a very well thought out format and game-play method and allows you to just focus on the game. Excellent app that I would recommend to anyone.,5
Awesome Love this app Helped me a lot to get information in detail with in very short time :),5

Good app  great support! I've had this app through 7 phones/44yrs and absolutely love it. Once I found the right scanner app (- this app doesn't recreate the wheel) If I can't figure something out  Evan responds to email w/in 48 hrs! Saves me from buying duplicate books because I simply cannot remember titles of &gt;2k books. Also helps me keep track of books to request for library or watch out for free from Amazon  B&N  etc. Create as many bookshelves as you want. Send books to Goodreads then import them into any new device.,5

Does only what it's supposed to do Free. Source code is available (it's a pretty easy read  if you're inclined). Small  simple program without bloat and unnecessary permissions. Simple light  nothing more. An immensely popular flashlight app installation was probably the straw that broke the camel's back when I used Android years back. I had handsets hijacked in spectacular fashion  and apparently that was (is?) typical of these stupid flashlight apps. Don't trust me  Google Android flashlight malware or somesuch. Or  just install this!,5
I really like this app,5

It's really fun and it still is fun after a few re-runs sadly their ain't too many floors but it's still fun and difficult. I like how those little festive things are in the game too aha the rat kings hat is cute :D. Would it ever be likely to see more floors or like a sequal of sorts of the game? That would be really fun.,5

Very nice gallery  100% clean permissions  open-source and constantly updated and answered. // Suggestion: It would be very useful to have a mini horizontal gallery at bottom like in the Gallery app from Samsung. 2.2.1: still has some problem with files and folders; eg. one folder is displayed twice  one with the files whose names start with # and the other with the rest of the files. However  when I make a copy of the folder it display correctly. Maybe I should post to GitHub with shots...,5

Must Have App!!! If you are running a bunch of apps  no matter what phone you have  you'll be able to squeeze every ounce of juice out of your phone with premium efficiently. The graphs seem to be broken as of Kitkat but is still amazingly useful and downright required for monitoring and tracking those pesky social media apps and other hidden things running in the background. It isn't the easiest thing to snag and use right out of the box so do yourself a favor and look up a guide on how to use this amazing tool effectively,5

Very nice overall Does exactly what it says on the tin: Shows an agenda view of the days ahead. For my personal tastes  two additions would make this perfect: 1. The option to draw attention to today's events somehow  maybe through highlighting them with a different colour than future events or marking them with a star or something. It's easy to overlook today's events sometimes  even though they're smack dab in front of you. 2. The option to personalize the background of the widget with a personal photo.,5

Incredible Everyone will have a different experience while using this app  binaural beats can be extremely powerful if you are open to the possibility. The app itself is simple to use and has some cool presets. Would like to be able to mess with them a little myself but there are other apps for such things. As for this one  awesome implementation and we'll worth checking out for anyone interested in this stuff. Easy 5 stars.,5

This emulator has potential to be the best of all emulators...but in my galaxy j7 2016 it lags pretty much...the sound is always muffled...but  after some changing I managed to play call of duty ... but now when I downloaded and tried to play God of war: chains of Olympus  it tells me to to active buffer rendering always...in non buffering mood the game is playing very good but the screen often goes black...in buffered rendering mood  it lags so much that it is nearly unplayable...even I have the frameskip rate at 8...can you guys fix this issue?? I mean  can you guys build the app as like it can play every supported game in non-buffered mode?? Pleeeeeeeease...........,5
Good indeed I love it,5

Great app except one issue Awesome app but there is one issue... At my office  there is a wi-fi connection but i am not using it (because it is password protected)... So since i haven't connected to that wi fi network  it is not there in the app's 'Wi-Fi Networks Remembered' list... In spite of that  the app turns on my wi-fi and when i disconnect it  it turns it on again. P. S: I am giving it 5 stars because i wanna encourage the developer to do more good work but i genuinely hope that this one issue is resolved..,5
It is a good thing to use for games,5

"I HAD to review this app. I was not looking for a budget/finance app with all kinds of bells and whistles like so many out there even ones that say """"Envelope Budgeting"""". What I needed was tracking cash in actual envelopes which is pre-budgeted  as in $150 for groceries for half the month (pay day is 1st and 15th). This works beautifully and simply. I almost deleted it though in frustration when I entered an expense and needed to delete it and couldn't figure out deleting. Swipe left worked. Yay.",5

Sony Xperia Active with Android 4.04. Tiny  free and add free application that does exactly what it is supposed to do. Basically  it is as if the application types for you in the browser address bar the path of the HTML file saved in your device internal storage when you open this file from your file manager. Tried from Total Commander with success. Therefore the result will depend on the browser that you select  and not on this application. Will not work with Opera Mini as Opera Mini loads from Opera servers the pages after optimization by Opera servers: Opera Mini cannot open HTML files saved on internal storage. You can select the default browser that will open the file  or you can make the application display all the available browsers for you to choose. You can donate if you want but it is not mandatory. On Motorola Defy+ with Android 2.3  and ES File Explorer this application is not necessary  the HTML file will open in the default browser when launched from ES File Explorer. Thanks to the developers.,5
Excellent! Easy to configure.,5
Cool,5

"Fantastic resource I downloaded it as a way to organize my wish list and found myself using the rest of the app as well. A couple things I'd like to see  as others mentioned  the ability to select other price guides or websites  as well as the ability to see prices in different currencies as I'm not American. This one is a small thing but I feel like it would be nice  when selecting """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""view card"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" from my wish list  I'd like to see the card as printed in the set I've selected instead of a default card.""""",5

The best and smallest editor & no ads I've used this app for several years and really enjoyed it. A few months back I went to use it again and it wouldn't work  so I went on the search for a new app. Wow  lots of apps but so full of ads between every single step plus they were 5 to 10 times larger using phone memory. Once they updated this app and got it working again I dumped the others with great joy.,5

ABSOLUTELY BEST MOBILE BROWSER. I've tried what feels like a hundred different mobile browsers. 90% have the Privacy Policy attitude of NSA and the rest is just buggy  slow and sometimes greedy or just bad. This one is an exception. It is literally the best browser on the Play Store.,5

Multiple uses I've had this app for over a yeah & it's helped me in many different ways. I use it to focus on work that I'm not exactly thrilled to do with the studying feature. I use the sleep induction and sometimes the lucid dream when I want to be aware in my dreams. I've noticed this has had an EMDR like experience for me  and I've actually been able to process and uncover some of my suppressed issues. Use a trained professional for trauma folks! Just wanted to relay that it happened. Thanks for the app!,5
Great app Keeps getting better too!,5
Works great No problems,5

Outstanding app (was: Great app  but I have one issue) Wow  within 12 hours of posting my review including a feature request  an update gets rolled out containing the feature! Probably coincidence  but wow! (was: I would like to see confirmation that all of my CPU cores are being overclocked. I've seen some overclocking apps only affect one core  and I want to be sure this app controls them all.),5
Awesome..great service Wow when I first tried to download it..the app didn't load..so I bought the app and it still didn't load...so I wrote to the maker of this app..he was so helpful...loved that he took the time to make sure I was a happy customer..turned out it was a glitch in the app store that day...next day it downloaded no problems...but was super nice of Will to help like he did..thanks...and anyone who is interested...app is amazing..and so helpful,5

Great app! This is the best barcode scanning app I've found. Additionally  it's free  ad-free  and open source. If you need a good barcode scanner  this is where you should start. Note: almost all of the bad reviews are because of permissions; the app description/FAQ explains why they're required  and the app is open source if you really want to verify it!,5

I want video call,5
Games that i play on this app are not starts without this thatswhy i like this😆,5
This is a simple yet effective application and I use it mostly for video recording and it gives great results. My phone lacked features like changing exposure and tap to focus while video recording but this app made it so easy to use. The one problem is that the flash doesn't turn on while video recording and I didn't try to click pictures using the flash. I've tried many settings but none of them gets the flash to work. It's kind of random. Sometimes it will work and sometimes it doesn't. And it works sometimes only in auto mode. And just to be clear the flashlight of my handset is fine and has no issues. The default camcorder can use the flash to shoot videos. I'll be glad if the developers can see to it if there are multiple reports like this.,5

Good,5
This app lets me see photos sorted by when they were taken or last modified rather than having to search through folders such as various camera apps  downloads folder  screenshots  image editors and so on. * This feature is a very hard one to find because many of the apps descriptions  sound like they support it  but they don't. * Also you can punch to zoom in our out to view thumbnails at your preference of size. Frequent updates is a good thing  it means it wasn't abandoned.,5
Hi and when I updated the app or service and after some time the I got system update which is good.,5
This is our go to messaging app for both personal and business use. Great email replacement and for team file sharing. The voice call feature really makes it usable for international travel and secure conversations  hopefully group calls will follow. Thanks to the Durovs and the Telegram team for giving us such a robust product  free from commercial interests. It is appreciated. Keep up the good work.,5

The only one with this feature It's the only alarm app that tells me how long before the alarm that I am setting will go off. It is a way to spot check that I don't have my AM and PM mixed up  AND it calculates how many hours of sleep I'll get and I can adjust the wake time accordingly.,5
Totally revolutionized the user interface of my phone. I suggest to make the small grid app drawer customizable  especially in color and fonts. 😀,5
It irritates so much time after you download whatsapp to update it,5

Happily used for years on PC. I'm so pleased this app has come to Android as I have used the PC version for many years and it has never failed me once. Now I can continuously access my password list wherever I am.

Many thanks for bringing this to the Android platform.,5

Worked great on my Nexus 6 to enable tap to wake  after all other apps and methods failed! Love it! Thanks! BTW  Adiutor is spelled right  it is Latin for helper  assistant. Pretty brainy reference!!! Kernel Helper would be okay too! ;),5
Great game. Needs more content. Although a bit grindy  this game really exceeded my expectations for a phone game. It's super simple to play  no ads every two seconds AT ALL  good quest stories  good equipment variety  etc.. I can't wait until the next major patch where more content will be released (lack of developers).,5

FYI For the other reviewers This service is the backbone of Android. All Google Apps depend on it. I know that it requires a lot of space and permissions but trust me  this service is crucial for nearly every Android phone 📱 to work  including Google Play Store.,5
I love google,5
Better than official app The official app does not at present work on lollipop. So looking for an alternative for the future I stumbled upon this app. What's not to like? Does ask the functions I use and it allows you to control all volumes of your players  just like ipeng  now if it had a peng party app... I cannot comment on plug ins as I don't use them yet  I'm too busy rediscovering my old CD collection  lol.,5
Very useful With this  you won't have to worry about forgetting to turn to 'silent' mode as long as you set it up according to your schedule.,5

Brijesh Singh,5
NetGuard is the only NoRoot firewall which is still under development. Using it for months. Blocked unwanted apps very nicely. Already purchased log feature from the app. One request- there are tons of system app/processes which makes confusing which one to be left open and which one is not essential. Therefore a recommendation inside the app would help for better choice.,5
I love it 😄😄,5
Hit,5
yasin this app is nice,5
Please provide the #facility to delete the files directly from the app instead of directory to remove file from phone not from group or app one can redownload it,5

Excellent app and customer service I've been using this app for a while and find it really useful. Only gap (or so I thought) was the ability to grab a screen shot and attach it to a receipt.

Awesome night mode for Nougat!!,5

The best epub reader now with sync across devices and Calibre plug-in I've used FBReader for a few years and it has got better and better. It was already very neat app with good options for fonts  backlight  page turning  online stores and so on. Recently it gained Google Drive integration so you can keep your books synced across Android devices  and there is also available a Calibre plug-in so you can download from your desktop/laptop based Calibre library. FBReader now makes for a very good replacement for Amazon's Kindle app.,5
Good,5

Google Authenticator's time limited tokens are as good as 2factor authentication gets without a hardware token. The app is very simple and easy to use. Worth noting: This app is not just for Google accounts - I'm able to use it with QuickBooks as well  and hopefully more websites will start supporting it soon.,5
Need more levels. I play it over and over so more levels would be nice,5
Super app i was play the wwe 2k 14 in this app i love it,5

I've decided to look for an alternative to Minecraft ever since some...monetization decisions regarding handling of user-created content. I think I've found what I've been looking for which is this game. What I love about this game is the customizability this offers in terms of modding. I had lots of fun trying to pick out mods to install in this game to tweak this game to my liking and I guess this is the charm of Minetest. My only minor gripe for this game so far is the d-pad being kinda small  and there needs to be an option to resize it.,5
It's a good app but it keep shutting down on me,5

It's great  it does everything I need and it's free  so I can't really complain. I just wish 'cut + paste' actually did cut and paste. To me  it just makes a new copy instead of moving. Other than that  perfect! Good looking  fast moving and customizable. 👍,5

OPEN CAMRA (Mark Harman) I was searching for such an app because my stock camera records vedios with low voice. But this app provides to use different options to choose audio source and I found excellent recording of vedio with CLEAR AUDIO in three options like 'default  ext.mic and voice optimised. By using option of Camcorder for audio source recording is nt good because audio gets weak. It is proved that this app is excellent beyond any doubt and the best part as appreciated by all is that it is add free. Thank you.,5

Needs better support for uploading. Everything works pretty well  except the auto-upload feature. Unless you have it turned up crazy high (uploading every minute)  you will miss data. The settings warn against setting the log filename to a frequent interval  but even with the defaults  you will miss 1 hour of stats every day. If this gets fixed  I'll rate 5 stars  but until then  this app basically doesn't do what it's supposed to.,5

"Very useful software Its a very useful software  but there is one little suggestion that I have that I think can improve it. If you can make this application detect whether the user is actively using the device or not  and if they are using it  then there isn't any point to send the notification. Because they are seeing the notification themselves on the device. For example if you can make an option in the configuration page of the application  something like: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Send notifications only when the device is locked."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and the application detects that the phone is locked (not in use physically) it should send the notification  otherwise not. That too could be an 'option' of course for those who'd like to opt for it. The reason I am saying this could be useful is because in my Ubuntu setup  I keep a record of all the notifications like android. So all of the notifications that I received when I was away are stacked. Now  when I am away from my computer  I am probably using my phone. So when i come back  at times i have up to 50 or 60 notifications which all of them I have read on the phone. Do you think this is possible?""""",5

As simple or configurable as you need it to be. Set it up once and it does the job well. I use it to archive all my SMS and calls to my gmail so I can search all email and SMS together. Has also been very useful when I switch phones. I can restore my call logs and SMS messages if required.,5

Love this App,5
It works! ... that already makes is better than most competitors. It would be nice if the power button was not hidden on a menu.,5
I got this because Hangouts won't support SMS messages anymore. And it looks the same  except better: it even has a night mode. One problem : when receiving messages  pop up windows open instead of banners up top  and the app has no settings to fix that mechanic. Moez  please add a setting change for that so I can just see banners instead.,5
Thank you for having APP like this its easy to use,5

After diagnosing the problem I was able to download a firewall and block the data-hungry processes when on data. Thanks developer! It's amazing that this app is for free! :),5

I love this app! I have used this for a long time now  but one thing I wish they would add is the option to have either an outline or dropshadow on the characters in your dashclock  because I love the simple white clock widget look  but on some backgrounds it is unreadable  and I don't like the look of the black option  or the option that has a background on the widget! So please consider either a black outline option  or a bit of a dropshadow option. Thanks!,5

Incredible. More than one can imagine. From the impossible changing an I - phone battery. To fender strat teardown. If they dont have it they will get you to where you need to go to do it. I must say simply MARVELOUS. KSW GITAR OKLAHOMA.,5
Just found this app today after the app I had been using for years stopped working with Android 7 and my LG v20 phone. I actually enjoy this app more. Runs smoothly  no delays or glitches. Simple to set up. Doesn't effect battery life at all. Thanks to the developer for a great app and I hope to be able to use it for all additional Android updates. Thanks.,5

Rapid sync  no clutter  privacy Thanks to the developers for this wonderful application which replaces my android stock app. I almost gave up on finding a mail app which doesn't ask for a ton of permissions until I found K9. A few minor suggestions for improvements: It should be possible to move mails to folders of different accounts  and generally the moving of mails could still be simplified. Another desirable feature would be a rapid delete gesture and an undo button for the last move/delete action.,5

Great............… This is the dream book reading app for me. Thank you very much for this app. Specially the option to search words in the dictionary paved the way for us the non English speakers to submerge into the world of literature without worrying about vocabulary. And there are also a lot of awesome free books to download. The page turning animations are also cool. The only thing that I'll like to have is to be able to turn page while in zoomed in position in any place on the page............,5

Nothing like Minecraft. So many people will download this thinking that it is a Minecraft clone  but it is nothing like that. The crafting takes some getting used to  but the pause screen (accessed by the 'back button) tells you everything you could possibly want to know. The only problems are that the settings are not pointed to at the beginning with some kind of notification. P.S. this version has multiplayer support with the computer version.,5
Use this,5
So far this camera app is easy to use. I only have one problem where is the sutter sound off? Other than that all is good.,5

Absolutely Fantastic I really loved the terminal launcher but what if Android Tech comes out with a new version of Android  which actually has apps rendered with terminal skin. For e.g. when we would open WhatsApp in that new version it shouldn't display as displayed currently but similar to shell launcher's display when we switch on the phone. That would be pretty awesome. Entire android version in that skin. I am not talking about themes.,5

Brought back so many memories It's absolutely amazing! Though not all games work  those that do work flawlessly. You even get a variety of different options which can be modified individually for each game to make it work and look better. There is a fully customizable control layout and functionality to remember settings and save points individually for every game! This emulator has BLOWN me away. Cheers to the devs.,5

Best Open Source OTP This is by far the best open source OTP app I've found. It's only downfall is that it lacks many of the features in the closed source apps such as backup/restore. However  2 factor auth is all about being in control of my accounts  so I'm willing to forgo some of these highly desirable features in favor of open source.,5

Works great on Galaxy S6 For those reporting errors using an S6 the app. needs to be manually started on boot/reboot. Once started it works as advertised. If you experience any trouble please go to Settings  Application  Running and check that the app is indeed running. Many battery saving apps will close it. Make sure it is Ignored. I am running Android 5.0.2 rooted. An excellent time saver.,5
Other developers should take notes from this app  it's ligtht  looks simple and great  it has all important features it needs and it is free with no ads. I would even support this app by paying for it or donating.,5
Great Wallpaper App Really unique curated wallpaper concept and the classic artwork is great. Wish there was a wider variety of content sources and high quality 3rd party content providers but this should honestly be a standard built in wallpaper experience for mobile and desktop. Great concept and great job executing it.,5

ESSENTIAL Tool - INSTALL THIS NOW AND READ ON CURRENT MALWARE Having been very heavily into modifying Android devices for about 8 years. Admittedly I became very overconfident  VERY STUPIDLY stopped following most Android threads. Considering I work in information technology I fully admit this was a CRITICAL ERROR on my part... Noob level BAD. if I had room to explain the issues I could have avoided if I had this application before a week ago even the most die-hard of Android lovers would flash stock or even perhaps go apple. I feel sick saying that...,5

A good dependable workhorse app that gets daily use. (Edit: Gestures had been enabled but wasn't always reliable and had to swipe as taps poorly detected. However  after recent updates is now very smooth. Now a 5* app),5

There is some issues with certain midi files with improperly programmed sheet music that causes tempo to be out of range of the this app. This is not the fault of the developer.

Hands down. Amazing App! I was having major battery drain issues. Using OS monitor  I was able to narrow it down to Google Play Services. I turned off sync location and all of a sudden CPU usage dropped to nothing. Upon restarting location services  CPU usage stayed low. But once I re-enabled sync I saw CPU usage jump back up to ~20%. That's when I knew where my issue was. I would have been lost without this app!,5
Perfect,5
The Mark Of Good Code Very impressive for an open source app. Might not meet all your needs but it is very clean and customisable not mention ad free. Thank you devs. Keep hacking strong.,5

Amazing power and control The last camera app you will ever need! Phenomenal control of all aspects of taking pictures. This has to be the best camera app I have ever used  out of at least 50 that I have tried. You can set the controls in any way you want  and gain the most out of your photographic experience. Including the size of the photos and videos used  storage location  exposure levels  and even the UI look and feel. I recommend this to everyone who uses their phone to take pictures. Thank you Mark! Great work!,5
So good,5
Good,5
Superior to the NPR one app With this app I can actually pick the different programs that I want to listen to and then create a playlist. Why would anybody want an app that lacks that capability? This app is definitely the better of the two choices!,5

I love dsub and use it everyday. the only thing I'd like to see changed is that cached files have normal file extensions. currently they are named xxxx.complete.mp3 and it messes with backing them up. It's a very minor issue that most people won't have a problem with though. Thanks  amazing app!,5

I love using the app vs having to use a pc or tablet all the time. The only trouble I am having is figuring how to change on the app from blog I created for an organization to another blog I have created for a different organization. Any help would be appreciated. Do I simply sign out and open under the second one which has a different name  email and password? When I went to sign out on the app to ion another blog it was saying I would lose some things. Thank you.,5

Indispensable I've used this app for ages and it's a vital part of power user phone management. Knowing at a quick glance what is taking up the most space on your phone may surprise you. I've had situations where camera got switched to internal storage randomly  or rogue apps get an ever increasing cache (I'm looking at you download manager!)  etc. Without an app like this you might never notice. It's great and easy to use. I get everyone I know to use it.,5

Request + Thanks Thank you  just started using but the app looks streamless. One request would be to make a widget where you can expand the app to a full or half screen so that my habits are the first thing I see when looking at my phone without having to click on the app to open  much like how calendar has it so you can view a half screen of what your dailey schedule looks like without having to open the app. Best regards!,5

Google shows you want you want to see  but that's not the reason why search engines were created at first. I don't want to see what pleases me the most. I am a researcher  I like to know about things and I like to explore and I can't let google trap me into illusions of what I like to see. To me  Google is a like a mirror. Mirrors don't lie  but mirrors do hide. I want a glass  not tinted  nor opaque. I want to learn the 'new' and not be trapped into a loop of related things.,5

A favorite app. Far superior to the limited offline capability of Google Maps. Efficient use of storage web vector maps. Extensive offline POIs (varies by region; less in some less developed countries). Enhancement would be less overlap in POI categories but that is  perhaps  inevitable with open source (crowd sourced) app.,5
Runs great. Better then null dc. This emulator runs better on my Note 4 then null dc does on my pc. Now I can finally enjoy heavy metal geomatrixs again.,5
Very good,5
I like this,5
Very good fr most part but it still has its glitches that needs fixed,5
"This is exactly what I was looking  a simple camera with no over the top features. If you don't use your camera often and only take a few pictures here and there  I highly recommend this app. As the title suggest  it is incredibly simple but functional. One cosmetic change I would like to see is the shutter/""""take photo"""" button. It makes the app feel a little dated. I think a simple circle like Googles camera app would look better.",5
The BEST This is the app hands down!,5

very importent...,5
used it now and its good I haven't used it yet i just had to reply to Brandon. Apps like these dont use your camera! The reason why it 'sees through walls' is because its using your location data. If you point your phone to the ground it will see through the planet lol. Try to understand things before you score them Incorrectly.,5
Better than that other one - you know the one I'm taking about  right? Very complete  no frills busybox installer,5

Quick  easy to read and flexible. The way you can zoom in and out around the disk to determine where your space is taken up is very intuitive. Exactly what is needed from a disk space analysis tool. A great way to see which apps have downloaded bucketloads of data in the background to hide in those .obb folders  or to see that you've saved way too many 1080P videos using the camera on your device..,5

"No root + KitKat + BBS = Some features unavailable Loved this app on my previous phone  but on latest phone (OnePlus One  running CM11S 4.4.2)  at first I got a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Failed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" message in response to the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Install as System App"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" prompt. Turns out Android 4.4+ necessitates root for all of BBS' features to become operative. (Not developer's fault; blame Google...) READ THE DEVELOPER'S FAQ FIRST BEFORE INSTALLING! Note: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Refund"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature was not available in Google Play store  even immediately after purchase  for this app. (Why?) Oops! (Edited review to reflect belated reading of KitKat-related FAQ and also excellent response from developer in helping me. I never wanted a refund; only more time to figure out what I needed to know before installing!)""""",5

As a keyboard it works well free of slipping. But the best part is dictation I.e. speech to text or you may call it speech recognition. Speech recognition or speech to text is best. No need for any other note pad for taking dictation. One can just store the notes in any type of database and process anyway one wants to the last part was dictated using the keyboard there were some errors but they are acceptable.,5

Great for finding the Apps that are using up your space. If you're constantly running out of space on your internal storage (or external storage) and can't figure out why  this is a must have app !. I especially like the latest update that shows app data correctly and not as system data. This allowed me to free up 3GB of storage used by Google Photos & Download Manager. Both apps I don't need and so I deleted the data storage in each app & disabled them. Excellent !,5
Love the crosswords Greatly enjoy the easy access to many public puzzles! The only things I don't like are minor glitches...the annoying accidental zooms  the occasional puzzle that has something other than a single letter in some boxes and doesn't recognize when it's complete  and inability to turn off error counting. I'm not competing against anyone  so why do I need for all the mistypes from my phone's tiny keys to be thrown back at me? Take a bit of the fun out.,5

Love it! My husband is a pilot  and I can now look at charts and even help him sometimes! I've found AF/D info for him instantly  and once I handed him my phone to check position so he could keep the Garmin 430 display on something else. He has Avare on his phone too  and bought a tablet for Avare. I use it for reading library book downloads and on trips for email and Web browsing. Avare has made all this possible. Thank you!,5

Amazing free aviation app for Android Nexus 5 running Android 6.0 Marshmallow  and Avare can't get past the registration screen. I can't tap anything to get it to continue and allow me to actually register  and it keeps telling me to register. Probably 5 stars whenever the developer gives this a compatibility update. EDIT: Speedy reply from the developer in my email. Had to go into Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Avare &gt; Permissions (grant all). That got it working as advertised! Great app  thanks for helping me solve this issue!,5
OK,5
Awesome But we need updates,5

No issue I get the songs I want. The search is efficient. There aren't too many adds and there is an option to get rid of them which is highly beneficial. And this is the first and only music downloader I've had that hasn't fucked me over and frustrated me to bits. I absolutely love it,5

This app is amazing! Best invention ever!! 😍😍😍😍,5
An actual review of this app Not the screen casting feature of Android. This is just a shortcut that saves me a couple of taps and a lot of scrolling. It takes me straight to those settings. It even provides a widget to streamline that process even further. As a side note  casting is most reliable on my phone if I reboot before starting it. The reviews on this app are the worst I've ever seen. None of them were about the app itself.,5
This app is very Good,5
Awesome!! It realy helps with games and evrything! My phone is so fast! Keep it up!,5
Thanks so much for fixing the bug! I stayed with this app all through not being able to see selections because it's honestly the best organising tool I've found so far. I can budget my list and organise by the aisle ....awesome,5

Excellent port. The game is better to play now on Android  than it was on a Linux PC. The game has many options to control gameplay. The three control modes are really welcome. In the past  it irritated me somewhat to use the keyboard. Now  the point-to-shoot control is so easy and intuitive. It's really great that people are porting Linux stuff to Android.,5

Great app. Super easy to use. I've tried a few of the other apps out there in the store  but this one is the easiest to use. Minimalist layout makes quickly figuring out when the next train is departing/arriving a breeze. Perfect for riders already familiar with the BART system.,5
Very convenient app.,5
Fantastic app with great features Three cheers for open source!!! This app is a first class podcast manager with great features for power users while still being simple enough for newcomers. The development community is responsive to bug reports. All around a great example of what quality open source on Android can be :),5

Old Friend I've had an iteration of Ringdroid on my phones dating back to the ironically named Droid from Motorola circa 2009.

So much depth. The developer has done a lot to change the game from Pixel Dungeon. Lots of changes you don't notice at first and it certainly changes how you play. Because of it's Rogue-like nature  it has immense replay value. The developer is also wonderful in their responses to suggestions. Thanks for this game  Evan.,5

"Update: As this is one of my primary apps on Android  it's great to see that it has been open-sourced as promised. Also  the dates thing below has been worked out  and subtasks is behaving as desired and the UI is beautiful. And with the new """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""flick"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" motions  I can finally say that my Android tasks PIM is better than the one I had on Palm. Nice job  guys! ======================================================================================== Update: It seems tasks are laid out according to GMT  rather than local time  on the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Due"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tab (Today  Tomorrow  Next Days  Someday). Due dates display correctly in editing and on the server. This makes it a bit difficult to see what you've entered for Tomorrow  as it appears as Today  etc. There's also some inconsistency when dealing with subtasks. It seems there may be two or more standards for specifying them: one way wherein the subtask is entered as a new line in the Description field  and another using a more formal specification. Otherwise a nice little app. Looking forward to paying a few bucks for it once the kinks are worked out.""""",5
Installed and saved,5
Quality App Just what I have been looking for. Please I would like to know if their is a way I can prevent the app from opening application when that full name is typed. I want it to respond to only the alias. Is that possible? Also  the listen command needs debugging. My phone ? hang when I try to load a music. It also do not respond to the music commands. FINALLY  WHAT IS THE COMMAND TO ACCESS MY PHONE SETTINGS??,5

Amazing! I have had insomnia for over 35 years. Most sleep medications don't work on me  or have unwanted side effects. The Sleep Induction tone played so I can Just hear it with the background sounds turned off (which I find distracting) puts me to sleep almost every time. This app is worth it just for that One setting. I have been using all sorts of binaural CDs and apps for years. This one seems to have the best frequencies for the job. This app is the best I've found of its kind.,5

A stunning combination of utilitarianism & minimalism I rarely feel the urge to leave a review of any app but Transdrone physically moves me to leave a review it does exactly what it is supposed to do in such a simple and yet beautiful way  once you have it configured it just works no questions asked I mean I enabled the labels plugin in deluge about a week ago and today I noted that Transdrone had picked this up and allowed me to label downloads as if I was using the webui or desktop application I was just flabbergasted that it works so well! Its such a rare thing now to come across such a well developed and thought out android app and I applaud the developer.,5

Perfect Starting learning Angular on my android device everything works perfectly  although can't do npm start as it needs to run 2 processes concurrently. So instead I created 3 sessions: 1 npm run tsc:w for compiling 2 npm run lite for the server and 3 vim to edit files. Amazing experience so far.,5
Love this app. So simply to use  just point your phone or tablet towards the sky and navigate. And each star and constellation will be shown through the screen. Very useful for people who are curious to know each star in the night sky.,5

Only for one or two reasons I give this keyboard app 5 stars for two reasons alone. There's nothing overly impressive about it  other than the ability to change keyboards quickly and that they have multiple options for those  like Klingon. If it wasn't for those  it'd be just another typical app for me.,5

TALK ABOUT USEFUL I just downloaded this 3 minutes ago and it has forever improved my life. Probably the most useful app I got. You can have many things copied at the same time,5
A Great Hiking App I downloaded the free version and used for a week before buying the + version a few months ago. I have been delighted with its functionality and ease of use. Yes  you do have to pay attention to the guidance given on how to set it up properly  but it is not difficult (I use a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 and a Motorola Moto G 3 phone using Android Marshmallow). Saving and replaying GPX tracks is easy (I save mine to the cloud)  the map detail excellent  the overlays are handy (I use a Microsoft Earth overlay option at 30%  transparency to give a little more detail to the OSM vector map)  contours and other plug ins are excellent. I am very much hoping that an update with a route elevation profile will come out soon. Overall a first class app  thank you,5

The best gallery app I've ever had. It does what a gallery app is supposed to do. Simple folder view  ability to create folders  copy and move media and the hidden folders feature. Since I bought my phone I've been using the default app  which is beautiful but disorganized. This is just way better  no ads  no online sync bs. Keep up the great work!,5

I don't know what could be causing the issue  but this is the only app that it effects. thank you!,5

By far the best I've used I tried half a dozen different podcast apps before finding one that was actually intuitive to navigate.

I've been using it for quite a while and love it. Only complaints are with lollipop's new lock screen (wish it could go straight to pattern lock rather than slide) The design is elegant and a beautiful way of showing notifications  much cleaner than the lollipop notifications. There is one thing I'd love to have implemented: music control. Would it be possible for you to choose to play/pause/fwd/back depending on what controls are in the notification? Edit: holy crap thank you!! He listened! Edit: Podcast addict does not seem to have playback control. not sure if this is a fix on the display side.,5

Best CAS for Android! Started using this after Octave port became nagware. It takes a while to get used to but is breeze once you get to know the commands and syntax. The manual is very helpful and have quite a few examples for almost all the commands. Since the outputs are rendered using MathJax  you can export the output to LaTeX. This makes it great companion for compiling TeX documents on the go. Kudos to the developer for bringing Maxima to Android and keeping the spirit of open source! Much appreciated.,5

Through a series of event of phone crash and non working OISafe  I discovered this website and read Ulrik Lauren's post and WOW!  It worked for me too. I had almost given up regaining my passwords through OISafe but just couldn't find any other password app that I liked or trusted like OISafe. I am so thankful you posted this help. Before going to the Application Manager and selecting permissions for storage in the OISafe app  I copied the two files  oisafe.csv and oisafe. xml to the root directory of the sdcard and the phone. I also put it in the downloads folder. I deleted the app itself and reinstalled it. The app said it found the import file ( it had done that before but never resulted in anything--- before the remedy of in the application manager-- and Woop  there it was  all of my data. Bottom line this is a great and simple password app and there is nothing else like it out there. I hope they do indeed have an upgrade in the near future as I was told in an email from them.,5
Nothing to say  it's simply awesome Wow  this is giving me the best experience of using Wikipedia app.,5

Works great so far  better than others This is my second full use podcast app  I used another one for many months that started to crash my phone  using its free version  so I was not about to pay for it when free was messing with Android.

Super App. I made this app as my system app. I didn't find anymore other apps like it. Cause it gave me much benefit in my swap ram with low memory killer function... My phone cleaned ram memory at a very aggressive. And so I couldn't play hd game with swap ram perfectly. And it is only one app which stopped low memory killer with so little aggressive. And now I can play hd game with swap Ram perfectly and can use upto 350 MB swap. Before I couldn't use upto 150 mb swap ram.. Many many thanks to developers...........,5

Extremely fast This is probably the fastest Mandelbrot fractal zoomer on the web. The zoom function is much easier to use compared to the other fractal explorers. I also like how easy it is to switch to the Julia set. Plus it's open source and ad-free. There are a few things that could improve it  however. When I try to swipe around to move the view  the Julia pin appears and is distracting. Maybe disable the julia pin from appearing while moving the view. A way to view the coordinates of the julia pin would also be nice.,5

Pretty good app. Forgot to add the card. 1996 world champion tho,5
Book Catalogue I have looked far and wide for an app like this. Awesome app very convenient and very quick. Love the fact that cover art loads for you. Is there a PC version of this avaliable somewhere that can be synched with the mobile app? Developers should consider doing the same app but for movies as I really like the layout.,5

Great app. But  you have a bug that blocks and freezes your site.plus a delet (singular per site),5
Ive basically been playing this game for years now. Not all the time  but its the one game I always have on my phone for when I want to play every couple months. Its a learning curve and I almost always make it to like the 10th floor not trying now. This game is supposed to be hard  so stop bitching about how much YOU are bad at the game  not it being hard.,5
Gut gut That's German... good for finding big things in your device's storage... no doubt,5

Unfortunately it has stopped scrobbling tracks played in Poweramp sometime last week (it's not even placing them in the cache). Soundcloud and Spotify are still working fine. Otherwise this app is working great :) Poweramp: alpha-build-703-play(Full Version) Scrobbler: v1.5.1,5
Fixed it. Thanks! Edit. Fixed! . (Aaaannnd... You broke it. Takes forever to bootstrap and won't connect with orfox. Plus the old interface was way better.),5
Awesome Specially the bookshelf idea 💪👍,5

Never leave home without it Fantastic application  and I truly mean that. The only thing I would like is to be able to set the cache location to my SD card so I can cache loads of stuff at a single time (for when I'm back-country camping).,5
Phenominal app! This is exactly what I was looking for to visualize what was chewing up all the space on my phone! The interface is simple and clear. I was able to see that the cache on my download manager was hogging up 4GB of space. Deleted. Done. Thank you!,5

Excellent ! The best! Simple and straightforward in its approach. You want to read a book ? Turn on the app.... Open book library..... Pick a book....

Perfect app  prefer the old icon As the title says  the app works perfectly and I love the quick reply feature. This app fits in well with stock android M apps with material design and such. Could we possibly get the option for using the old icon style as I liked the ability to have the icon the same as my theme and the new icon just doesn't fit with material design in my eyes. UPDATE: Developer responded and applied an upgrade to bring back icon styling  top developer that listens to the community!,5

New material design version is fantastic! Looks great and fixed the constant server errors too! I have used Transdrone for some time now  but it was always frustrating because of constant server error messages  and then when really bad  it would take a bit of juggling wifi on and off and force stopping the app to get it to connect again. Since the update to the new material design version  I've not once had a server error message--not even when batch deleting a bunch of torrents (which used to cause server errors almost every time). And on top of the functionality  the new interface is fantastic!,5

Nearly perfect This is a fantastic IRC chat app. Clean and thoughtfully-designed user interface that is intuitive and doesn't get in your way  and supports just about all the features I use. Only thing I wish it had was the ability to automatically select from among multiple servers and ports (mainly because some FreeNode servers don't work on my employer's firewalled WiFi network).,5
Its good,5

Bummer I've had this app for a long time and always enjoyed it. Having my contacts all synced is a big deal to me but now it's all ruined. I will still rate five stars because I realize it's not the developer's fault. I do hope that you can find a solution for this sooner rather than later. Will keep the app and will check for updates.,5
Kiwix wikipedia offline Its verry intresting,5

Great versatile app overall  if a tad overwhelming. Suggestions: - Allow image review  deletion and sharing within app (also for DNG). - Show a preview for the optional time stamp when recording. - In the options  show right away if an option is activated or not (now i still have to tap the option to see if it is activated). Anyway  thanks.,5

Good app But i have one problem . In my log for the month from 4.2.16 to 27.2.16 my kilometers and amount of feul use/purchase are on the dot correct. But my avg feul that i get when i work it out and what the app says it is are different for the month . Why is that and how does it work out the avg feul consumption for a month. Day to day avg feul consumption in the statistics are also correct.,5

I read more news in this app,5
Amazing but Flawed I love PD  but Shattered blows that and all the other mods out of the water. It's a ton of fun and totally addicting. However  there is one thing that I cannot stand...after playing hundreds of runs and making it to the final boss only once it seems apparent that the game beats you 9 times out of 10 before you even start. I wish there was a better balance of items (especially for melee characters...) so that you didn't have to choose to quit even when you get far enough in. Ugh here I go again...,5

Great app & works perfectly on my S7. I love the options to make games run and look well above and beyond what original PSP games looked like but I can't figure out if I can make the app save my settings so that I don't have to redo them every single time I turn it on. Am I missing something or does the app just not save your settings?,5
